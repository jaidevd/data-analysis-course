Hello, and welcome to this course on Data Analytics with Excel.

We are collecting more and more data than ever before in history. And there's an
entire industry around analyzing and interpreting that data. The objective of
this course is to not only make you comfortable with the practice of data
analytics, but also to make you significantly competent within this industry.

So far, we have mostly been grasping at straws - analysis has not been able to keep up with the
volume of data. It seems like no matter how much money or energy we invest in
analyzing data, we cannot keep up with the demand. One of the major reasons why
this happens is because data analysis as an industrial discipline tends to be
fairly ad-hoc in it's approach to data. One of the most important things you are
going to learn in this course is how to take a structured approach towards
analyzing data. You will see that having a structure, a process makes you
significantly more effective. It brings more discipline and rigour to the
practice, it helps you avoid wastage - wastage of analysis, wastage of energy and
ultimately wastage of time. And since it's a well defined, well structured process,
with some luck, you should also be able to automate this process.


The final aspect of this course is the tool we will use - spreadsheets.
Spreadsheets have, quite simply, changed the world. If we, as a species were
facing extinction, and had to preserve our top five technologies, spreadsheets
would definitely one of them. In fact, Fred Brooks said that spreadsheets are
one of the biggest innovations in computing since databases and high level
programming languages. Excel is quite simply, the single most versatile
analytical tool anyone can use. Dollar for dollar, it far outweighs pretty much
anything else. Of course, note that whatever we do with Excel in this course,
should also be doable with any spreadsheet software, like LibreOffice Calc, or
Google Sheets.

Having said that, also note that we will only be using Excel as a vehicle for 
analytics. In the analytics industry, the only thing as abundant as the data
itself is opinions about which tool is the best. And I believe that the sooner
you try to lay this question to rest, the better. My current boss is S Anand, who
is the CEO of Gramener, and consistently ranked in the top ten data scientists
in India. He says that tools do not matter, technique does. A good analyst is
someone who is able to perform good analysis with any tool. The best tool you
have is between your ears. So ultimately, my job here is to teach the process
and methods of data analysis, with Microsoft Excel as a tool, a vehicle.
You should be able to replicate this process with any other tool that you are
comfortable with. In fact, that would be a good test of how well you have
understood the material.

So with that, let's get started.
