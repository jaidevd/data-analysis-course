* Data storytelling is a critical skill for scientists, analysts and managers
* Rob Walker & Joshua Glenn
* 30X return
* Stories are memorable and viral - people remember stories, they'll act. People
  share stories - that enables collective action
* Analysts present their work, not their message
* Share the analysis as stories


* 85% companies have lost track of how many dashboards they have

1. What question does the dashboard answer?
2. Is the answer evident from the dashboard?
3. What action should the user take now?

Frame the question - "Why analyze data?" as - "Well, what'd happen if you just
present your work itself? The Data itself?" Then lead to the dashboard paradox
from the PyCon talk. Then take stuff from Anand's material.

We've been telling stories for a long time - Florence Nightingale's charts.

Data journalism does a good job of it, it hasn't necessarily translated to the
corporate world.

The Process
===========

1. Understanding the audience and the intent

	1. The audience determines the stories. Determine your audience - these are
	   called personas. Give a couple of examples.
	2. Do it
	3. Check it

	For each persona, fill the following form:
	```
	As a [persona], I'm in a [situation] where I face [problem], leading to
	[consequence]. Solving it by [action] leads to [impact].
	```

2. Finding insights

	1. Analysis is not insight, it is a superset of insight.
	2. An insight is something that is BUS
	3. For each insight, do a {high, medium, low} rating against each of the
	   BUS metrics
	4. Only those that are high or medium on all aspects are insights.
	5. Fill this sheet yourself, then ask the audience - because they have
	   the right context on BUS.

3. Storylining
	1. The last step of the last process is the beginning point of this one.
	2. All stories have *characters* - human or otherwise.
	3. Pick a set of insights - stitch them together.
	4. Start with the elevator pitch, the one sentence summary, the final
	   takeaway, the moral of the story.
	5. If we remember morals of stories, why not remember the morals of
	   presentations?
	6. There is one takeaway - find **only** the insights that support the
	   takeaway. Use the Lion and the Mouse story.
	7. Add context to the selected analysis by:
		a. comparing with other metrics - compare with history, other
		divisions, etc.
		b. adding analogies - "if the sun were to shrink to the size of
		a grain of sand, the nearest star would be 13 km away."
		c. Add a business interpretation - For every $1 discount,
		customer LTV increases by $24.
	8. Order these messages into a tree.
