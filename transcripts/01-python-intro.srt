Hello and welcome to this course on data analytics with Python.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,460
My name is Jaidev Deshpande and I am an Associate Principal Data Scientist at Gramenar, which

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,880
is a data science company.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,880
We are collecting more and more data than ever before in history and there is an entire

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,320
industry around analyzing and interpreting this data.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,120
The objective of this course is not only to make you comfortable within the practice of

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,240
data analytics, but also to make you significantly competent within this industry.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,480
You see, so far we have mostly been grasping at straws.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,080
Analysis has not been able to keep up with the volume of data.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,960
It seems like no matter how much money or energy we invest in analyzing data, we cannot

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,640
keep up with the demand really.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,320
One of the major reasons why this happens is because data analysis as an industrial

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,880
vocational discipline tends to be fairly ad hoc and in its approach to data.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,960
One of the most important things you are going to learn in this course is how to take a structured

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,040
approach towards analyzing data.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,160
You will see that having a structure, a process makes you significantly more effective.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,440
It brings more discipline, more rigor to the practice and helps you avoid wastage, which

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,920
is a wastage of analysis, wastage of energy, ultimately that of time and money as well.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,160
And since it is a well-defined, well-structured process, with some luck, you should be able

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,720
to automate this process also.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,480
Now a major aspect of this course is the tool that we will use, which is Python and some

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
of its libraries.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,400
Python is an old language, in fact, it is older than Java, but its use as a primary

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,600
language for data science has exploded in the last 5 to 10 years.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,160
More and more practitioners are slowly moving away from domain specific tools like MATLAB

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,280
or even Excel towards Python.

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,840
And the reason is that Python is the only general purpose programming language that

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,920
has a plethora of different easy to use libraries for data analysis.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,600
Note that data analysis is usually only one block in a larger pipeline, which ultimately

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,960
creates your product or your service.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,920
And having the whole pipeline in a single language is easier for most developers and

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,040
practitioners rather than having a different software stack for each block.

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,080
Having said that, also note that we are only going to be using Python as a vehicle for

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
analytics.

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,880
In the industry, the only thing as abundant as data itself is opinions about which tool

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
is the best.

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,880
And I believe that the sooner you lay this question to rest, the better for everyone.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,600
Tools do not matter, technique does.

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,360
A good analyst is somebody who is able to perform good analysis with any tool that is

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,600
available to them.

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,640
The idea is not basically overfitting on one tool, but being able to pick up and learn

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,240
new and new tools fairly quickly.

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,040
The best tool that you have, remember, is between your ears.

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,440
So ultimately, my job here is to teach you the process and methods of data analysis with

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,320
Python as a tool, as a vehicle.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,280
You should be able to replicate this process with pretty much any other tool that you are

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
comfortable with.

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,000
In fact, that would be a good test of how well you have understood the material.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,360
So with that, let us get started.
