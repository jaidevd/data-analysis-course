00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Welcome back. We have already gone through a bunch of theory about univariate, bivariate

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,000
and multivariate analysis and now we have a good idea of how to deal with different

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,460
kinds of variables and what sort of inference we can draw from those variables. In this

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:22,200
video we are going to get started with Excel and how we can use all the univariate, bivariate

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,880
analysis techniques that we have studied so far within Excel. Specifically in this particular

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,160
video we are going to deal with how to do basic arithmetic using Excel and how we can

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,800
extend that same idea to come up with better statistics, more complicated insights and

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,820
so on. First of all this is a little small so we can just go to the view tab over here

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:53,640
and do a zoom to 100 percent so that our text looks fairly readable. So as you can see this

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,760
is the iris data set which you have seen a few times before. As we know we have four

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,480
numerical columns in this data set and we have one categorical column in this data set

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,480
which is the species of a given flower and every row is basically a sample of the flower

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,760
and every value over here is basically the measurement in centimeters of one specific

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,520
attribute of that flower. So basically for this particular row what this means is that

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,960
the sample length of this particular flower was 5.1 centimeters, the sample width was

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,840
3.5 centimeters, the petal length was 1.4 centimeters and the petal width was 0.2 centimeters

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,520
and this particularly was a setosa version of the iris. So let's see what we can do with

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,720
this sort of data. Let's try and get started with some basic univariate statistics. Before

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,000
we start we have to designate the first row of our data as the header. You see Excel yet

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,520
doesn't know that this is our header. Now in order to do that we can just go to the

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,840
view tab over here and we can click on freeze top row. So when that happens you see that

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,660
Excel has frozen the top row which means that no matter how much I scale I can always see

23
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,680
the top row no matter how much I scroll. So what that means is that Excel now knows that

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:17,800
this is the header of my file. Now one of the most important univariate statistics

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,360
that we have is the mean or the average. So let's try and calculate the average of the

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,720
sample length column. So in order to do that first what I'm going to do is need the sum

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:36,320
of all the values in this column. Now in order to do that we are going to use an Excel formula.

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,480
There is a special way to use an Excel formula. You see whenever you are in a particular cell

29
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:52,560
of Excel you can just start writing anything. So I can type this. This is basically just

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,480
me writing text in certain cells of the Excel sheet. But if I want to start writing a formula

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,920
I have to begin by pressing the equal to key. So basically this is now going to be interpreted

32
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,800
as my formula. So I can just write something like sum of A to A. What that means is that

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,600
take the sum of the entire A column. This is my A column and A to A what it means is

34
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,400
that take the whole column into consideration and then in order to execute that formula

35
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,680
we just press enter. So that's what we know. 805.6 is the sum of this particular column.

36
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,640
Of course if we also knew the exact length of the column, we know that the numerical

37
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,840
values start from row number 2 and go all the way up to row number 139. So I can also

38
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,320
have a specific range instead of the whole column. So for example I can have sum of A2

39
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,400
to A139 and you see that we get exactly the same value. But of course it's not always possible to

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,400
know the complete length of the column without scrolling down. So that's why we can just use

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,360
E colon A wherever it applies. Now that we know that this is the sum, so let's call it

42
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:19,360
as sum of simple length. Let's correct the typo. Now the next thing we need in order to find the

43
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,320
mean is basically the count of this particular column and that can easily be obtained by another

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:33,680
formula which is called simply count. Here again I give it an A colon A because again it just

45
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,880
helps me not, saves me the trouble of typing the exact coordinates of where the columns are.

46
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,720
So that's it. I know that I have a 138 rows in my column and then my mean, I can just call this the

47
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,560
count and let's make a little space so that the values and their names are readable. So this is

48
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,800
the sum of the simple length column, this is the count of the simple length column and then the

49
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:12,640
average of the simple length would be another excel formula which I can just say it's equal to

50
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:21,360
this value divided by this value. So what I did was I simply wrote an equal to sign and I clicked

51
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,560
on a particular value then I typed in the slash sign which indicates division and I clicked on

52
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,960
the other cell that actually was the divisor and then when I press enter that's it. That's

53
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:43,200
basically the mean of my particular column. Now let's try and continue this with the other

54
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,680
columns so let's say I want to do the same thing but for the simple width column so I'll just

55
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,520
basically do sum of b to b and then I would just do count of b to b well in this case obviously

56
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,240
it's not going to change. Oh that didn't work you see because I did not precede this with an equal

57
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,880
to sign and that's why excel could not interpret this as a formula so when I do that it gives me

58
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,520
138 and then again I simply say that this is a formula which divides the cell which is g5

59
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,040
divided by the cell which is h5 and then I just press enter and that's the average of the simple

60
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:29,520
width then again I can do the same with the petal length which is c to c then again I do a count

61
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:38,000
and made the same mistake again almost c to c and then I just say that this is a formula which is

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:48,640
g6 divided by h6. For the sake of completeness let's also finish this for the petal width column

63
00:06:48,640 --> 00:07:04,240
which is d to d d to d and we have a count of d to d and then we simply have g7 divided by

64
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:12,000
h7 and there it is those are basically our average values of all the four columns now actually

65
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,640
instead of doing each of these steps manually there is a smarter way to do this let us write

66
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:24,400
down the names of our columns over here so let me just copy these names and let's say that we

67
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,720
type them down over here and let's say that here I want the sum so basically when I do

68
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,600
a sum of a to a that gives me my sum 805.86 now I don't really have to copy and paste the same

69
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,120
formula or you know everywhere else what I can do simply is drag this so when I drag this particular

70
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,920
formula you see that it automatically scales to figure out the correct formula substitution for

71
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,160
the rest of the columns and you can see when you click on this particular cell you can see the

72
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,120
formula here it's basically a colon a and when you click on this one you see that it's basically

73
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:12,080
sorry yeah when you change it you can see that it's b to b and then you see it it's c to c

74
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,360
and again sum of d to d so basically we didn't have to manually type down any of these formula

75
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,320
it's basically all of it is straight away present for us so we all you have to do is basically just

76
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,120
take this formula and drag it across so this is basically called a range selection in excel

77
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,600
and excel is smart enough to figure out what are the values over which you're trying to apply a

78
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,360
formula based on how far you're dragging it and what is the original what is the original

79
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,800
formula so it's pretty smart like that now let's say that I have all my sums ready in this particular

80
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,240
column then I can just do a count column or in this particular row that is then I can do a

81
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:56,480
count row which I can simply say as count of a to a and there it is and again as usual I just drag

82
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,440
this so basically it gives me the count for all columns and if you look at the formula at the top

83
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,680
left over here it's count of a to a then it's count of b to b then it's count of c to c and then

84
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,640
it's count of d to d and then finally when I come to the mean here I can basically just say this is

85
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,200
equal to this particular value divided by this particular value and that's it that's my mean

86
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,040
this also is draggable so when I do that it basically drags to give me the same values as here

87
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,200
so you see this is basically h12 divided by h13 this is i12 divided by i13 and this is j12 divided

88
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,120
by j13 so basically these are my means and I can very easily calculate them just by filling in one

89
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,560
formula and then expanding it to fill all the columns of interest now note that this is just

90
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,280
an example of how you can use excel to do basic arithmetic which is basically sum and division

91
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,920
multiplication and subtraction also works in a very similar way

92
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,600
and we are going to see examples of that very soon however we didn't even have to calculate the mean

93
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,680
manually by summing and dividing there is already a formula for v

94
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,960
as you might have guessed it's excel after all you can just say average

95
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,600
there it is and you can just drag this over as we know already and you see that we get

96
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,800
the direct values exactly so let's just call this the direct average right so that's our average

97
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:37,440
essentially let's continue and try to compute the variance also this time so as we know the variance

98
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,240
is basically you take the average of a particular column you subtract each value from the column

99
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,120
that average and then you square that value and take the average of that value so essentially

100
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,240
what this does is that I am basically going to take the sum of a particular column which is say

101
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,040
a to a or in this case I will give the explicit range which is a is to a 138 then I have to

102
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:11,760
basically sorry this should be a 138 and then I have to subtract essentially the mean and we know

103
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,080
that the mean is this I have to then square it so basically that carrot symbol means exponentiation

104
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,400
and then I square it to the second power and then finally I divide it by the count which is 138 so

105
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:31,280
that gives me the variance of the sepal length column and again I can just drag this to include

106
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,600
the variances for all the other columns and of course this was a variance that we calculated

107
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,480
by actually applying this particular formula let's take a look at the formula a little more

108
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,680
carefully we took a column we subtracted the mean of that column which was present here

109
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,000
and then we squared the column added it up and then divided it by the count of that particular

110
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,480
column so that's basically what gives us our mean sorry our variance obviously there is also a

111
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,040
direct formula for variance there are actually two formulas one is called a population variance

112
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,920
versus a sample variance so in this case we are talking about a sample variance so in this case

113
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,480
we can just do a to a and there it is it produces a sample variance of 0.69 looks like we were a

114
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,000
little off but that's because we might have considered the value the formula that we considered

115
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,520
could have been the formula for the population variance instead of the sample variance so let's

116
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,880
try and change this and see if we can actually replicate the same thing with the population

117
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,000
variance and yeah that's a much closer value and again I can just scale this up and that gives me

118
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,840
the variances the directly computed variances of all columns the last thing that we need to consider

119
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,480
is say the standard deviation so let's just call it std and that would just be the square root of

120
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,280
this which we have known since the previous video so we can just say another formula for

121
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,080
taking the square root which is sqrt and then you just click the value for which you want to

122
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,240
take the square root or essentially fill in its cell number and then you finish that so that's

123
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,560
basically the standard deviation as usual I can just drag that and there it is however as usual

124
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,240
as you might have expected so far there is also something called the standard deviation

125
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,680
a direct standard deviation so I can do something like std ev again since it was a population

126
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,080
variation we can population variance we can use the variance the standard deviation value

127
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,040
which corresponds to the population so that would simply mean a to a and that gives us

128
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,600
pretty much the same value and as you extend it there we are so that basically gives us most of

129
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,440
the univariate matrix which we can apply on continuous or numerical columns

130
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,560
so these are all the statistical mathematical movements and the

131
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,920
metrics that we can derive from our data we had also discussed some graphical ways of deriving

132
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,400
univariate analysis specifically for numerical columns those are histograms so let's see how we

133
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,920
can draw histograms well it's fairly simple in excel you just select a column and then you go

134
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,520
to the insert tab and say that you want to insert a chart so this is the area where you are going

135
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,600
to find all your charts now the chart that we are looking at is a statistical chart but let's also

136
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,040
take a look at what excel recommends so this is a button for recommended charts and you see that

137
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,000
it's basically going to give us bunch of scatter plots it's going to give us histograms it's going

138
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,120
to give us Pareto distributions so obviously we want histograms so let's click on histograms

139
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,000
and there it is that's basically the histogram of sepal length let's just move it a little

140
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,960
outside so that we can still see everything that's already there so there it is i can also click on

141
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:10,080
this particular button here to change you know the color of it so basically it's blue and let's say

142
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,960
i want it in green so i can click on this it becomes green and i can edit the chart title

143
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:28,800
i can say that this is basically the histogram of sepal length and there it is that's basically

144
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:37,040
how i can quickly draw histogram using excel if i want to do it for another column again i do the

145
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,360
same thing i go to the i select the column i go to the insert tab i look at either the recommended

146
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,760
charts and if the histogram doesn't show up in the recommended charts i simply go to the button

147
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,280
which corresponds to the statistical charts which is this one and i click there and i see that there

148
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,040
is an option here for a histogram and that essentially gives me my histogram for the petal

149
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,520
width column as well and again i can use a bunch of different styles with these charts so as you

150
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,080
see we can change the color but here we can also change the whole style so let's say i want something

151
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,320
like this with a black background and a slightly matte kind of a finish then this is what my chart

152
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,080
looks like remember that you can just choose any sort of a slide or style that you want and you can

153
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,840
use any sort of a color that you want you can also size these accordingly you can edit the markers

154
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,960
and the titles as and when you like so that is how you can get histograms out of excel

155
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,080
so that takes care of all the univariate analysis that we can do on continuous variables but we

156
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,680
haven't exactly thought of what we can do with categorical variables that is for example something

157
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,800
like the species column so let's see what we can do with them let's move this entire section of

158
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:06,000
work out of here so that we can basically make some room for our analysis for the categorical data

159
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
now as we know the only thing we can do with categorical data in this case is count it

160
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,040
it doesn't support any other operations now in order to count how many different values are present

161
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,200
and how frequently they occur the first thing i need to do is figure out what are the unique

162
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,680
values that are actually present in that so for example let's say i have this column e which is

163
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,360
the species column and i want to figure out how many different species are there

164
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,600
if i do a quick scroll i see that setto size there there's versicolor and there is also virginica

165
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,760
in some parts of the data set however i want to programmatically using excel find out which are

166
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,960
the unique values so what i can do then is go to the data tab and i can say that i want to do an

167
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,960
advanced filter when i click on the advanced filter you'll get this warning but that's okay

168
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,480
you'll see that you get this window which will let you specify what sort of a filtering you want

169
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,880
so let's say that i want don't want to filter the list in place but i want to copy the output to

170
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:11,360
some other location so basically let's do that and we say that the range is this and i only want

171
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,920
unique records and i want to copy to say a particular file which is say f115 and when i

172
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,800
click on okay that's what i get i get species setosa versicolor and virginica so now i have

173
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,080
the unique species ready under this particular column so i have species here and let's also

174
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,400
create something called a count so now i just want to count how many setosas are there how many

175
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,080
versiculars are there and how many virginicas are there simple way to do that is to use another

176
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,200
formula called the count if formula so basically what count if does is it counts values in a given

177
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,760
selection that is a range so let's say my range is basically the entire column which is e to e and

178
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,640
the criteria is basically what you want to match it with and the criteria i want to be setosa what

179
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:11,280
this means is that the criteria is setosa so what i mean by this is that count the whole column e to

180
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:18,400
e if any value matches setosa and then i can just press enter and so it tells me that it has 46

181
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,040
columns similarly i can just do a copy and paste it over the new columns and it gives me 46 so

182
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,120
basically here i'm saying that count all the values in species such that they are versicolor

183
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,400
count all the values in species such that they are virginica so that's how i get my count values

184
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,960
now one quick way to basically convert this also into a graphic is to select this data let's say

185
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,600
that these are my unique species and these are their counts of course in this particular case

186
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,120
it's a balanced data set so all species are equally probable and equally present and then

187
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,480
again i can go to insert and i can insert yet another chart so i can say that i want to create

188
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,960
a pie chart and there it is that's our chart we have setosa versicolor and virginica all occupying

189
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,640
exactly 33 percent of the pie chart and that's how we can simply do a counting of

190
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,480
the frequencies within a particular categorical column
