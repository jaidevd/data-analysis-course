00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
In the last video we spoke about the genesis of data: what place the analysis

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,960
of data occupies in business intelligence and strategy and what it

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,000
means for practitioners. In this video we are going to take a deeper look at

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,120
the motivation behind some of the analytical practices that we are going

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:27,840
to learn in this course. As a quick recap remember that these four stages are the

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,840
stages of the data cycle: generation, acquisition, analysis and consumption. We

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,880
had spoken about how everybody consumes analysis but very inefficiently. Let's

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:46,000
take a deeper look at why that happens and what we can do to fix it. To

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,040
begin with first and foremost most analysts have a habit of simply

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,440
reporting their analysis as plain bare facts. We usually don't take the effort

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,120
of weaving these facts together in a story like narrative. Now why is this

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,960
important? Because stories are what people remember. Facts on the other hand

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,880
are bits of information that people are likely to forget. Of course we are not

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,160
suggesting that facts are not important, quite the opposite in fact, but they have

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,920
to be presented as stories. There is a very good reason why slogans, poems and

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,000
joomlas are more effective in, say, political rhetoric than plain bare facts.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,400
As an example there is this website called significantobjects.com on which

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,560
Rob Walker and Joshua Glenn tried to sell a bunch of common objects. What they

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,720
did differently was that they paid a few writers to write short stories about

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,640
these objects. So for example this is an object called Thai hooks and you know

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,840
there is a fairly elaborate story written about that. And they found out

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,560
that objects which had stories behind them were likely to be sold at a much

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:12,240
higher rate than the ones that just had an item description. So if you were to

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,200
quantify the impact of stories on these sales, note that in this particular quick

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,600
case they had a return of more than 3000%. In summary, stories are what

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,960
people share and remember. But we as analysts have a very different problem.

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,220
At the outset let me acknowledge that data analysis is really hard. Not

28
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,200
everybody can do it effectively and because it is difficult we tend to

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,640
cling to every single piece of analysis we perform even if some of it may not

30
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,360
help the point we're trying to make. Even if some of it is not what the audience

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,280
asked for. Secondly remember that your audience will almost never be able to

32
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,120
replicate the nuances of data analysis. So it is not your analysis that is likely

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:08,000
to impress your audience but the story that you weave around it. Now analysis may

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
be hard but a lot of it is also a fairly mechanical process. What you do with one

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,680
data set you just have to sit down and do with another data set. What you do

36
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,240
with a particular column or a given set of numbers you just have to sit down

37
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,320
and do the same with another set of numbers. You draw charts and then you

38
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,680
replicate that chart for other data sets. That's what I mean when I say that

39
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,240
analytics can become somewhat mechanical. There's always an element of repetition

40
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,960
to it and it is for this reason that many self-service business intelligence

41
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,880
tools are trying to automate the most routine parts of data analysis. Excel,

42
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,560
Power BI and Tableau are all self-service business intelligence tools

43
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,360
which only ask the user to click and point, drag and drop elements onto the

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,600
dashboards which reflect your analytics. And since these tools are cheap the rate

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,480
at which companies build dashboards has grown exponentially. Building dashboards

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,480
is easier and cheaper than ever before. And it's easy to make the dashboard look

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,360
pretty even if it doesn't convey anything meaningful. That's why it's very

48
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,680
easy to lose track of how many dashboards we generate and what they do.

49
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,320
This is a major problem that troubles a lot of companies that use self-service

50
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,920
BI tools. But there are three major problems with most dashboards.

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:50,600
It is usually not clear what question a dashboard answers. In fact we don't even

52
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,040
know if there is a question that the dashboard is attempting to answer. To

53
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,080
figure it out you have to look at each individual chart or graphic on the

54
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,560
dashboard and interpret it. That is not easy. Secondly the answer is not obvious

55
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,800
from the dashboard. Very rarely do we find a dashboard that tells us exactly

56
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,640
what we need to know. In fact often the analyst who creates a dashboard has to

57
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,840
painstakingly, at length explain what the dashboard is trying to say. Interpreting

58
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,680
a dashboard without talking to the analyst who created it is often very

59
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,600
difficult. Actually if there is one thing you take away from this course let it be

60
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,160
this: Do not be that person who creates complicated dashboards and then becomes

61
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,200
a bottleneck when it comes to the interpretation of those dashboards. Let

62
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,160
your work speak for itself. Finally the biggest problem with dashboards is that

63
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,000
they don't make it very clear as to what action you should take based on the

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,760
inference you draw from the dashboard. That is often left as an exercise to the

65
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,480
reader. Which means that after spending a lot of time and money on analyzing

66
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,840
data the user still has to do their own data interpretation. In other words

67
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,000
dashboards tend to be descriptive rather than prescriptive. And what can be more

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,560
prescriptive than stories? After all every story has a moral and that moral

69
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:19,560
is what tells you what action the user should take. But this is not a new idea.

70
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,720
We have been telling stories with data for a very long time. What you see here

71
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,480
is called a Nightingale Rose chart. It is basically a circular bar chart which was

72
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,560
first created by Florence Nightingale, the lady with the lamp. In addition to

73
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,480
being a nurse she was also a statistician. As you can see the title here

74
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,000
it's the diagram of the causes of mortality. She started collecting data

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
on why and how soldiers died during the Crimean War. And if you look at the

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,200
description the pink area here represents the number of soldiers who

77
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,400
died because of battlefield wounds. And the gray area outside represent soldiers

78
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,960
who died because of infectious diseases. Infections that were

79
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,480
contracted not in the war but in the hospitals which were overflowing with

80
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,880
wounded soldiers. And we can see that nowadays we are seeing a fairly similar

81
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,760
trend with the COVID pandemic. We have hospitals overflowing with COVID patients

82
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,280
and that is where people who have non-COVID problems also are having a

83
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,440
difficult time getting admitted. So broadly what happened is that Florence

84
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,040
Nightingale demonstrated that more people were dying because of infections

85
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:41,400
rather than because of their battlefield wounds. She took this chart to the Queen

86
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,040
of England with a very clear message that you need to be spending more on

87
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,880
hospitals than military supplies. And she walked out with funding. Imagine what

88
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:56,640
would have happened if she had let the Queen interpret all this chart by herself.
