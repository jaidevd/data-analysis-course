00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,880
Welcome back. Now that we have a fairly detailed understanding of what patterns of insights are,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,640
what bus metrics are and how we can use them to tailor our analysis for a particular data set,

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,960
we are going to try and apply it on this particular data set that is the Titanic data set.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,440
Essentially this is a data set which contains details of about 800 passengers that were

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,280
unfortunately aboard the Titanic in 1912 when it sank. And the idea is how well can you predict

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,760
who's going to survive and who won't survive. So we already have this data set downloaded,

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,920
you can just search for this data set on Kaggle, you can just Google Titanic data set

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:57,280
and the first link probably the first link you're going to find is the link to the Kaggle data set.

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,280
You'll just have to go ahead and download the data which we have done and we have it here.

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,080
So this basically is the main file in that data set. Let's go ahead and open it.

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:26,720
So there we are. Let's maximize this a little bit. Let's zoom in

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,360
and also let's freeze the top row as is the custom and there we are. Now we are ready for

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,040
some analysis. Now one of the first things we are going to do is instead of diving headfirst

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,240
into the analysis we are going to draw on the patterns of insights that we have learned

15
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,360
in an earlier video and try and see if we can come up with certain questions based on those patterns

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,800
and then we are going to use those questions to drive our analysis. Essentially we are going to

17
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,280
go through each pattern of analysis and see what sort of questions we can draw from it and instead

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,520
of doing the analysis willy-dilly or just going through multivariate, bivariate or

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,720
multivariate analysis we are going to use these questions and try to find their answers through

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,440
whatever analytical tool that we can come up with. So let's try and come up with a list of questions.

21
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,240
So let's try to write down our questions here. Let's just simply rename this particular sheet to

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,800
patterns of insights and there we are. Well this too needs to be zoomed to 200% let's say

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,800
and the first thing we are going to need is a list of columns because until we know what each

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,840
column means we wouldn't really be able to come up with questions. So let us copy over the columns

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,640
from the first row of the sheet. Now I can straight away see that passenger ID is just

26
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,040
an idea of the passenger so we're probably not going to need this column because we can

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:16,720
do nothing with the ID itself. So let's copy the remaining columns and paste them over here.

28
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,600
Actually we shouldn't be having them like this. Let's try and lay them out in rows so we can do

29
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:32,320
something like transpose of this particular selection and then close it and there we are.

30
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,480
So we can try and see if we can delete this. Well you see we can't delete this because then

31
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,200
the transpose will mess up. So let's leave it like that. Let's just delete this particular row.

32
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,360
There we are. So we have the name of the column and let's also add what that column

33
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,280
means. So if we look at the column survived we see that it's basically a column which has values

34
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,560
in 0 and 1 and if you go back to the page from where you downloaded this data you'll see that

35
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,320
these are basically binary indicators of whether a particular passenger survived or not. So

36
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,720
essentially a 1 means that a particular passenger survived. This particular person

37
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,320
Mrs. Jack Heath Futrell she survived but Mr. William Henry Allen did not survive.

38
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,720
So let's try and add that information here.

39
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,360
These comments are later going to help us when we try to frame up our questions.

40
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:42,400
E class is essentially again an integer indicator of the class of the passenger. So essentially

41
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,760
third class, first class and second class. So here we can simply say

42
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:58,000
passenger class, name is self-explanatory, sex is self-explanatory, age is self-explanatory as well.

43
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,000
We don't know what sibsp is so let's go back to the date to the page where we got the data from

44
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,720
and look at the data dictionary and here what they have said is that sibsp is the number of

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,360
siblings or spouses about the Titanic. So essentially for each passenger how many siblings

46
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,520
or spouses overall were about the Titanic. So let's just call it let's just simplify it say

47
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,720
number of siblings and spouses. Well you would assume everybody to have only one spouse but

48
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:42,720
you never know. Then again the next one is part which is the number of parents or children about

49
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,640
the Titanic. So we have siblings classified separately and parents and children classified

50
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,600
separately. Ticket, so ticket I think is just the ticket number and that I guess is just going to

51
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,920
be another unique idea. So not going to help us really. Then passenger fare is self-explanatory.

52
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,640
Cabin is something interesting, it's like cabin number. It's possible that multiple passengers

53
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:20,080
shared a cabin so multiple people could have a cabin number and let's say and we have also

54
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,240
something called embarked. So let's see what that means. Here the data says that embarked is basically

55
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,240
the port of embarkation. If you go back to the original data set which is in this particular sheet

56
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,080
we see that embark contains S, C and Q, three different unique values that keep on repeating

57
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:46,880
and the website tells us that C is Cherbourg, Q is Queenstown and S is Southampton. So let's just copy

58
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:59,040
this and paste that into our data dictionary. So now the next thing we are going to do is try and

59
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:07,760
look at some patterns of insights and based on that try and see if we can come up with some

60
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:20,400
questions. So let's try and do that. So the very first pattern of insight that we know is as we know

61
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,040
called an unknown result. So these are the most common types of patterns that are the most common

62
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,200
types of insights that we're going to draw. Let's simply list down a bunch of things that we might

63
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,880
want to generally find out through this data set. So these would all be unknown results so far because

64
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,120
we know nothing about the data so far. Obviously since it's a data set about the passengers of the

65
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,160
Titanic we might want to find out what is the survival rate. Now we know that this is going to

66
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,960
be a low figure. Essentially the Titanic disaster is known as one of the worst maritime disasters

67
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,360
in history and that is for good reason that is simply because a lot of people died but

68
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,720
exactly how many people died is not something we know and what is the probability of somebody

69
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,320
surviving on the Titanic is also not somebody we know. But since it is widely considered a disaster

70
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,680
we can safely assume that the probability is less than 50 percent of the survival rate is less than

71
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,720
50 percent. Whether it is actually less than 50 percent or not is something that we'll have to

72
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,360
verify through the data set. Well the other thing that we could find out by simply looking at these

73
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:41,680
columns is that what is the survival rate by class. So by passenger class what is the survival

74
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,840
rate. If you've seen the movie you might have seen those scenes where people from the second

75
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,720
and third classes were locked up or people from the first class or the higher classes were given

76
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,040
preference when the ship was being evacuated and when the lifeboats were being filled. We

77
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,920
have now an opportunity to figure out whether that was really true or whether it was just a

78
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,880
figment of James Cameron's imagination. Let's see if survival rate differs by class and if actually

79
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:20,080
the lower classes had a lower survival rate. Well one obvious thing that we know about the Titanic

80
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,200
is that women and children were allowed to evacuate the Titanic first. So essentially

81
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:34,160
survival rate by gender should be higher for women than for men. Let's see if that is true

82
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,360
and if actually it is true which probably most likely it is. Let's see what is the difference.

83
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,800
The other thing that we have is couple of variables related to families.

84
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:53,520
So we could also ask something like are people traveling with their families

85
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:05,040
more likely to survive. So this is something that we can infer from these two columns over here.

86
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:15,680
So that's it like those are broadly a few general questions that we can ask. Oh and we also have

87
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,520
the fare as a variable which is how much the ticket had cost. So we can also ask something like

88
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:30,160
apart from this is basically an extension of the survival rate by class problem. So we can ask

89
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:39,120
something like given that we have fare were people who paid a higher fare more likely to

90
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,560
survive. So let's find that out as well. So yeah those are broadly the kind of questions that we

91
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,680
can come up with when we think of unknown results as a pattern of insights. The next pattern of

92
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:02,080
insight that we know of is called surprising comparison. So these are essentially questions

93
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:17,360
like how does the survival rate compare between say gender, passenger class. Now maybe couple of

94
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,800
these questions we have already addressed here but anyway let's put them down here in the interest

95
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,760
of completeness. How does the survival rate compare between age for example are younger people more

96
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,840
likely to survive or are older people more likely to survive. And yeah the other one other variable

97
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:45,440
which we have not used so far is the embarkment. So whether you embarked on Cherbourg or Queenstown

98
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,760
or Southampton which of them makes you the most likely or the least likely to survive. So

99
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:59,360
how does the survival rate compare between embarkment ports. Let's just call this

100
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,960
embarkment for the sake of convenience. There we are and then we can also ask some other

101
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,480
question based on you know this particular pattern of insight based on say the family

102
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:27,120
so we can say that how do number of family members compare across gender. So basically

103
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,320
do men have more family members or do women have more family members. Passenger class

104
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,240
and what this means is that which class of passengers has more and less family members

105
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:48,080
traveling with this. Then age which what age how does the number of family members vary as

106
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,280
your age changes. So you would imagine that younger people children would be traveling with their

107
00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:00,320
family members and older people might not be traveling with their family members. Let's see

108
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,520
if that is true and again as usual the other variable that we have is embarkment. So let's

109
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,400
see what happens. Now the next pattern of insight that we have is surprising

110
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,200
extremes. Let's see what sort of thing we can come up with over here.

111
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,360
So here we have to frame questions that are in the superlator. We ask questions about highest

112
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:31,360
and lowest and things like that. So let's think about this. Yeah one question we can ask is

113
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:39,760
which passenger class had the highest or the lowest women passengers or you know

114
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,960
passengers

115
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:56,400
which passenger class had the highest or the lowest men or women. So gender ratio across classes.

116
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:08,880
Let's see what that gives us. We can then ask who are the oldest and the youngest people in each

117
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:17,840
class. So we are basically trying to combine extremes between the class variable as well as

118
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:27,280
the age variable. We can also say what was the highest or the lowest fare and then we can group

119
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:39,280
this again by age by gender by passenger class and by embarkment. So there is a bunch of things

120
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:45,440
that we have which we can use to do our analysis and of course like we can also say what is the

121
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:54,080
highest or lowest fare by survival because ultimately one of the things that people believe

122
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,880
about the Titanic may be perpetrated by the movie is that people who paid higher fares were more

123
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:08,560
likely to survive. Let's see if that is actually true. Then we also have abnormal distribution as

124
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,800
another class or another pattern of insights. So let's see what sort of distribution we expect

125
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:23,360
from this and what do we actually get. So we can ask something like what is the distribution of

126
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:36,000
passengers across well age passenger class fare. I'm not even sure if that really makes sense or

127
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,520
not like basically how do you even compare how many passengers paid what kind of fare.

128
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,960
Not sure if that really makes sense but let's leave it here for the sake of completion. This

129
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:53,120
is basically more of an exercise in how we frame questions rather than how we actually do the

130
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,360
analysis. The analysis is something that follows and anyway once we take a particular question and

131
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,280
try to tackle it how we exactly do the analysis and does the question itself make analytical sense

132
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,640
becomes a different argument completely. What is the distribution of passengers across

133
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:19,360
embarkment. So essentially you would expect that few children very few old people but a lot of

134
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,960
young and middle-aged people would be there by age. By passenger class you would expect that

135
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,440
very few people are in the first or second classes and a lot of people are there in the third class

136
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,600
as is true for most modes of travel fare. Again not too sure let's find out and

137
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,960
embarkment again we don't know what are the distributions of passengers that embarked in

138
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:50,960
CQRS so let's take a look. So I guess this is a fairly large set of questions that we have

139
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,520
and let's tackle them one by one through our analysis and see what we can get to.

140
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:07,520
So let's go back to the sheet with the data and try to start answering our questions.

141
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,240
Well the first question that we asked was what is the survival rate and that can be answered by

142
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,640
looking at this column. We essentially have a binary indicator which tells us whether a

143
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,960
particular passenger survived or not. So let's try and take a look at how we would solve this.

144
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,880
Now one way to calculate this is simply count the number of ones that are there in this whole

145
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,560
column and divide them by the total number of rows. So essentially we can simply say

146
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:49,360
sum of a to a and then simply divide it by the count of a to a. Now we see that we get the value

147
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,880
of 0.38 which means that the survival is 38 percent quite less than 50 percent as we expected.

148
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,320
So essentially what this means is that 38 percent of the passengers on the Titanic survived.

149
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,960
Now if we look at the formula here very carefully you will see that count a to a is the same as the

150
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,880
length of that column and when you have the sum of a column divided by the length of a column

151
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,520
that's nothing but the average. In general whenever you have a binary variable like this one or a

152
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:29,360
Boolean variable like this one the average is often a proxy for the probability of the positive

153
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:37,440
class. So instead of using this particular somewhat convoluted formula we can simply replace it with

154
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:46,480
average. So we can simply say average of a by a and that gives us the same value and that's a

155
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,600
good proxy to have because average is a formula that we are familiar with and it avoids us writing

156
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:01,760
a complicated formula. Now the next question that we had was what is the survival rate by class.

157
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,880
Now we have the survival rate in this particular column and we have already calculated it overall

158
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:16,800
and we have the class over here. So what we need to do first in order to find the survival rate

159
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,800
for each independent class is to filter this particular column by a particular class value.

160
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,720
So basically for the third class take all the rows which have three in this particular column

161
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,440
and then compute the survival rate for those rows separately then do the same for the first

162
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,720
class and then do the same for the second class. Now this is called a group by operation and one

163
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,400
easy way to do that in excel is to use a pivot table. So let's write this down

164
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,480
and let's go to the next cell and in order to create a pivot table we go to the insert tab and

165
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,720
we click on pivot table. Now it's going to ask us to select a table or range and it has very

166
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,880
helpfully already selected a range essentially all of these this boundary that you see with

167
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,360
the dotted lines that's basically the range that it has already selected for us and what it's going

168
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,200
to do is that it's going to use all of these columns to create the pivot table of course which

169
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:26,320
individual column to use for a particular metric that is up to us. So let's click on okay and here

170
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,760
we see the details of the pivot table. Now we need to find out the survival rate by class so

171
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,800
we need a table which shows each class in a given row and in the row next to it we need to see or

172
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,280
in the column next to it we need to see the survival rates. So what we need to do is take

173
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,480
the p class variable from here and drag it down to the rows section and then we need to take the

174
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,600
survive variable and drag it down to the values section. Now you see that it has already picked

175
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,960
a particular aggregation for us which is sum of survived. We don't need the sum here we actually

176
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,160
need the probability which in this case is also the average. So in order to change the sum to

177
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,480
the average we can simply right click on this particular field and go to field settings and

178
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,520
here as we see we have multiple different aggregations which are available to us and

179
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,080
the default value is sum we simply change it to average and then we click on okay. So there it is

180
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,640
those are the survival rates or probabilities of particular classes. Now in order to make it a

181
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,680
little more readable let's sort this in a descending manner by the average of survived. So essentially

182
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:48,560
we know that 62 percent passengers from the first class survived, 47 percent passengers from the

183
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:55,200
second class survived and 24 percent passengers from the third class survived. So this is fairly

184
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:04,880
significant and it's also fairly depressing in a way because what this means is that of the people

185
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,600
who were there in the first class for every three people roughly two of them survived whereas in

186
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,680
the second class every one out of two people survived whereas in the third class one out of

187
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,080
four people survived. So there is clearly a significant distinction between the survival

188
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,960
rates of the different classes that were about the Titanic. Let's take a look at the next question.

189
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,600
The next question is what is the survival rate by gender? Now the answer to this is not something

190
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,960
that should surprise everyone we clearly know for a fact that women would have a higher survival

191
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,520
rate but that is also something that we know from our general knowledge or whatever but let's see

192
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,360
if the data actually holds up and again to do that we have to create a new pivot table. We are

193
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,440
going to use a ton of pivot tables in this particular exercise by the way simply because

194
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,120
pivot tables are so convenient and they allow us to do a bunch of different operations very quickly.

195
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:08,400
So again we go to the insert tab and we click on pivot table it's the same range as usual and the

196
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,320
when we want to place the pivot table is this particular cell m10 and that is what it has

197
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:21,680
basically already selected over here and then we click on okay. Here we basically need in our rows

198
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,000
the sex because we want to figure out what is the survival rate for each individual gender and then

199
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,040
again we drag the survived column into the value section and here also as usual it's basically

200
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,720
giving us the sum. We don't want the sum we want the average so again we go to the field settings

201
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:50,560
and then we change the sum to average and we click on okay and there it is. So 74 percent of

202
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,720
the females about the Titanic survived whereas only 18 percent of the men about the Titanic

203
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,600
survived and that is obvious because we know that it's basically the females and the children who

204
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:13,360
were allowed to evacuate the sinking ship before anybody else. So that answers our next question

205
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,640
which is what is the survival rate by gender. So let's add this also here.

206
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,760
Let's give this a little more room so that we can read what we have done.

207
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:35,040
Let's go to the next question now and see are people traveling with their families more likely

208
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,000
to survive. Now this is a somewhat compounded question it's a somewhat complicated question

209
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,200
we don't know how to straight away answer with this because in our data set we don't see a

210
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,160
straight up column which tells us whether a particular passenger had a family on the Titanic

211
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,680
or not. However we do have two other columns from which this information can be derived. We know

212
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:06,080
for each passenger how many siblings were on the Titanic or spouse and we also know for each

213
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,760
passenger how many parents or children were on the Titanic. So what we can simply do is take the

214
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:19,040
sum of these two columns and that output the sum of siblings or spouses or parents and children

215
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,640
and children essentially gives us the number of family members that were there with a particular

216
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,160
passenger on the Titanic and if this number happens to be greater than zero then we can conclude that

217
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:38,480
somebody has a family on the Titanic. So let's try that. In order to compute this variable we'll

218
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:46,880
have to introduce a blank row and then fill that row with the sum of these two columns and then

219
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,480
see if that column is greater than zero or not. So let's insert a particular column that gives us

220
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,200
this column. Let's simply call it n underscore family which is the number of family members you

221
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:10,560
have and then we can simply do sum of this column plus this column and press enter. So there it is

222
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:17,440
this particular person which is Mr Owen Harris-Brown had one family member on the Titanic

223
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,920
and as usual we can simply drag this down all the way in the end

224
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:37,280
to apply that particular formula to the entire set of rows and we overshot it a little bit but

225
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,200
that's okay we get a bunch of zeros we can just reduce it a little bit and go down to

226
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:52,080
exactly 892 columns and there it is. So now we have a column which tells us what is the total

227
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,880
number of family members a person had when they were on the Titanic. Now we can simply convert

228
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,240
this into a Boolean variable. Basically if you remember the wording of our question was very

229
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,360
specific what we are asking is are people traveling with their families more likely to

230
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,200
survive which means that all we need to answer is whether somebody was traveling with their

231
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,120
family or not because whether they survived or not is already available to us here. So essentially

232
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,160
we just need to perform some sort of a logical operation on this column which tells us that

233
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,040
if this number is greater than zero then that person was traveling with their family or if

234
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,320
that number is zero then that person was not traveling with their family. So let's introduce

235
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:44,240
another column which we will simply call as family and in order to populate this again we

236
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,280
simply do an if operation. So an if is basically a formula which takes in a particular condition

237
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,080
and if that condition is true it picks one value and if it is not true it simply picks another

238
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:04,320
value. So let's say that our condition basically is h2 greater than zero and if that is the case

239
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,000
we want to call it true and if that is not the case we want to call it false and then we press

240
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:22,640
enter. So let's copy this and paste it all the way to the end of the sheet it went well beyond

241
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,400
the range so let's not do that because that will slow down the operation and let's go back to the

242
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:45,040
top and let's just drag this down until we reach 892 columns. There is a keyboard shortcut for this

243
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,720
basically you can just press a particular keyboard shortcut which will take you down to the end of

244
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,240
that particular data not to the end of the spreadsheet completely but somehow on my

245
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,920
computer i can't seem to make it work. So there it is essentially this particular person had five

246
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,480
family members therefore they were traveling with a family this person had three family members

247
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,880
so they were traveling with the families and others were not. So wherever there is a zero

248
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,400
we conclude that that person does not have a family and if there is a one then that person

249
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:29,280
has a family. So let's go back all the way up.

250
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,000
Now the question we had was is a person with a family more likely to survive or not. So

251
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,520
essentially what we need to do is find the survival rate depending on whether a particular

252
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:56,560
person has a family or not. So again we use a pivot table go back to the insert tab click on

253
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,360
pivot table and the same range is selected the new output range of the cell is also selected

254
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:11,040
you click on okay that gives us the pivot table and then we say that what i want in my rows is

255
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:18,320
basically whether a person had a family or not well it seems like those particular columns are

256
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,240
not showing up. So let's see what went wrong with our selection let's close this and delete this

257
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:42,400
particular pivot table well we can just instead of pressing the delete key we can just press

258
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,240
the undo key to make this work. Now let's see why it did not create the pivot table correctly for

259
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,360
us remember that we need the i column over here when you click on the pivot table you see that

260
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,240
it's only picking up to the it's actually picking up the has family column itself so

261
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,840
let's see why it wouldn't pick up the pivot table also.

262
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:17,360
Well let's see if we can directly select the columns like that and then make a pivot table.

263
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,520
So essentially instead of making a selection on its own we are creating a pivot table

264
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,720
by ourselves so we make the selection and we click on the pivot table and we say that we want

265
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:38,960
to place the pivot table in the existing sheet over here basically. So essentially let's click

266
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:46,080
on okay now we have the ith column and this time it says that a pivot table cannot overlap another

267
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,400
pivot table well we did not remove the original one so let's do that and then again select all

268
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:59,120
the rows from all the columns from a to i and click on insert pivot table again we want the

269
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,760
result to come up in the existing sheet which is over here let's click on okay

270
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,960
and there it is we have the has family variable available to us so let's drag that down to the

271
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:20,640
rows and let's as usual pick the survived column and drag it down to the values the sum which is

272
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,640
the default aggregation let's change that to average so instead of getting the total number

273
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,960
of people who survived we'll get essentially the probability of them surviving and there it is.

274
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,720
Essentially the idea is that if you have a family you have a 50% chance of survival

275
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,760
if you don't have a family then you have a 30.3% chance of survival.

276
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,320
Let's see how we can make this a little pretty we want to make it descending and we don't want

277
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:58,160
to see any blank values so there it is and let's again format this as percentages just in the

278
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:05,360
interest of better presentation so that it is nearly 51% people who have a family survived and

279
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,480
only 30% of the people who did not have a family survived now one of the reasons why

280
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,280
this could happen is that you can imagine a typical family consisting of a father a mother

281
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:25,200
and two or more children or even one child and you see that since women and children were evacuated

282
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,960
first it's possible that even within a family the rate of survival is something around at least

283
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,360
50% because there would be a man and a woman and if there are children then the rate of survival

284
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:45,360
would be more for if you consider a given family as the unit which we are considering for this

285
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,240
particular probabilistic analysis so that's why it makes sense that people who were traveling

286
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,920
with families had a higher rate of survival the only way that you would not survive if you

287
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:04,240
were in a family on the Titanic is if you were a man so that's why this is not too surprising

288
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:12,400
let's see what our next question is so were people who paid a higher fare more likely to survive

289
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,440
now let's think about how we could calculate this what we can do is simply have the fare over here

290
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:29,200
and let's format this as currency so here we can go to the formatting tab and we say that we want to

291
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,360
format this particular thing as a currency now clearly it has picked the Indian rupee

292
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:42,240
as the currency symbol but we can go a little ahead and click on more number formats and instead

293
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:51,440
of the rupee symbol we can use the Great Britain pound the reason I've chosen Great Britain pound

294
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:59,200
is because the Titanic started its voyage in England and it was going to the US so the fares

295
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,600
are likely to be in British pounds not in American dollars or rupees obviously so let's leave it at

296
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:14,320
that and there it is the idea is that we now want to figure out does paying a higher fare mean

297
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,360
that you are more likely to survive let's think a bit about how we would do that here again also

298
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,800
it's a case of bivariate analysis where we have one categorical variable which is simply true or

299
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:34,080
false and we have one numerical variable which is the fare so does increasing fare mean a better

300
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:42,560
chance of survival let's think about it well since one of our variables is actually a categorical

301
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,960
variable here also we have no choice but to do a group buy essentially we are going to figure out

302
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,240
if somebody survived or not and then check the average fare they they pay so essentially we can

303
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:05,520
say something like average fare by survival and again let's insert another pivot table

304
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,640
so here's basically seem to have messed up the selection but let's cancel it anyway

305
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,680
and let's restart again I clicked in the wrong place and that messed up the selection

306
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,640
so here's a selection and we want to place the result in the cell o 18 which is basically the

307
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:38,240
cell and we click on okay and here what we want to do is we want to have the survived factor

308
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:46,080
as our rows and we have the fare factor in our columns and here we have some affairs again let's

309
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:52,000
change that to average pairs one of the reasons we use average so often is because it gives us

310
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,080
the best of the worst kind of an estimate so there it is the people who did not survive

311
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:08,560
had an average pair of 22.1 gbp whereas those who survived had an average pair of 48.39 gbp

312
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:16,480
clearly means that the people who survived were basically paying more than twice the amount

313
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,560
on average of people who did not survive this is also a very stark contrast and

314
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,120
somewhat surprising result because you would not expect to find any correlation between

315
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,720
what fair people are paying versus whether they survived or not but anyway that's what the data

316
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:45,200
tells us so let's continue so the next question is amongst surprising comparisons how does the

317
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,840
survival rate compare between gender i think this is something we have already answered so if we go

318
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:57,840
back to see the survival rate by gender we have already answered how survival rate changes from

319
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:04,000
men to women so that question is answered we have done the same for passenger class but we have not

320
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,400
done that for age essentially we need to see how survival rate changes as your age group changes

321
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,040
now in order to do that we are going to have a slightly complicated type of a pivot table

322
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,920
so let's take a look

323
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,120
so let's write down the metric we are trying to measure here which is

324
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:34,640
rate of survival by age now here too we need a pivot table so let's go ahead and

325
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:44,320
insert a pivot table same range and there we are now here amongst the rows we basically want

326
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,600
ages so let's take the age column and drag it down to rows so there we have all the different

327
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,960
ages that are present in the data set we see that it's a fairly large list we might want to

328
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,280
group it down but see let's see what happens and again as usual in the values let's drag

329
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:10,400
the survived column here again it's the sum of survived instead of that let's do the average

330
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,880
of survived so there it is now you see that we have ages which are 0.42 0.67 1 2 3 4 9 basically

331
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,800
all integer ages are there there are also floating point ages in between so instead of dealing with

332
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,720
ages as the raw numerical number that they are let's group them together into pins and one way

333
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:38,480
to do that is to simply click on one particular age value in the table and click on the group

334
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:46,400
selection button over here which is available under the pivot table analyze tab of excel and

335
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,240
so when we click on group selection it gives us a menu so it's basically saying that starting at

336
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,080
0.42 which is the lowest value and ending at 80 which is the highest value we want to group the

337
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,720
whole range in groups of 10 let's start a little lower than 0.42 because we want the range to

338
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,600
slightly exceed the actual range and instead of ending at 80 let's end at 90 and group it into 10

339
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,600
and then when we click okay we see that the data becomes a lot more compact and instead of having

340
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,840
a survival rate at each unique value of age that is present in the data set we get aggregated

341
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:31,680
survival rate for different ranges of these values now those are our values let's sort this

342
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:39,440
by decreasing order and we want to sort by the average of survival so there it is basically

343
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,800
anybody who is between 80 to 90 years of age had a hundred percent chance of survival but at the

344
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,680
same time that you see that somebody is between 70 to 80 percent of age has a zero percent chance

345
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:58,320
of survival this probably is a fluke value what that means is that there's probably one or two

346
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,600
passengers who are in that age range and it just so happened that both of them survived or whatever

347
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,880
number there were in that range happened to survive and that's why it's getting a high rating but

348
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,480
you know the same cannot be said over the values clearly for lower values which is 0 to 10 or

349
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,080
we see that the survival rate is pretty high which is 60 percent that makes sense

350
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,600
children were allowed to evacuate first but at the same time if you look at the range of 10 to

351
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:34,560
20 years the survival rate falls a lot more below so there it is these are the different

352
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,760
survival rates as grouped by age

353
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,520
now the next question that we have is

354
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,040
how does the survival rate compare between embarkments so let's try that as well here

355
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,360
again let's click on the cell where we want to add our pivot table let's go to insert and again

356
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,720
insert a pivot table same range and when we click on okay we get the pivot table menu

357
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:17,920
here we are talking about embarkments so let's drag to back to a rows field and survive to the

358
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:30,480
columns field and change this to average and there it is so again we can clean this up a little bit

359
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,680
say that we don't want to see the blanks we want to sort by the age of survived in a descending

360
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:45,440
order and there it is so basically the people who embarked on c which is let's take a brief look at

361
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:53,520
what that is Cherbourg Queenstown and Southampton so basically the people who embarked on Cherbourg

362
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,960
had the highest chance of survival whereas those who embarked on Southampton had the lowest chance

363
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:08,000
of survival let's select these and format these as percentages in the sake of better presentation

364
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,280
so there we are so you see that most of these questions we have been able to answer through

365
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,600
a variety of pivot tables and that is why if there is one thing that you learn about excel

366
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,240
it's probably going to be pivot tables so that's pretty useful so let's proceed to our next set of

367
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:38,000
questions the next question is how do family members compare across gender so essentially

368
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,520
what we need to do is find out how many family members on average each particular gender had

369
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:56,160
so we can say something like this number of family members by let's say gender and let's insert our

370
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,800
pivot table over here so let's go to the insert tab click on pivot table and this time we want

371
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:10,320
to group the number of family members by gender so what we need to do is put the sex in the

372
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,400
basically the sex column from here we want to drag it into rows that gives us male and female

373
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,120
and we have we still don't have the number of family members columns which is n family again as

374
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,640
happened in the previous case the selection has failed to take these things into consideration

375
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:37,440
let us try and recreate the table again so let's undo this and see if we can create

376
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:47,440
this particular table and we also had basically the gender column so then again we click on

377
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:54,880
insert and we click on pivot table so there it is it has not picked up the correct one but we

378
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,840
can add it over here we can say that we want to pick up the range from

379
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,880
b and we want to pick up the h so there it is we only want it to pick up these two values

380
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,720
and that's good enough for us and we want to add the result in an existing worksheet which is this

381
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:26,560
one over all the way over here so let's click on okay it says that the data source reference

382
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:33,360
is not valid let's see what can go wrong over there let's cancel this and actually force select

383
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:43,120
all the can columns from a to h and that should give us a correct selection for the pivot table

384
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:49,600
so there it is and we want to add it to the existing worksheet over here and then we click on okay

385
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:58,960
and if you look at it yeah this time the number of family members has come up so let's say that

386
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:06,160
we take the sex in the rows column that gives us male and female and we also take the n family

387
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,840
members in the values column again let's convert the sum to an average

388
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:20,000
and there it is so here it is and let's clean this up and say that we don't want to see any

389
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,480
blanks and reset the table so phi waves had almost twice the average family members than men and this

390
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:38,240
is also understandable probably because women were not allowed to travel alone and they would

391
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:45,760
be accompanied by their family whereas men could travel alone and there it is so basically that's

392
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:57,680
basically how number of family members varies by gender so the next question is how do the

393
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,040
number of family members compare across passenger class we could simply create another pivot table

394
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,560
but for convenience we can just modify this existing pivot table so let's see how to do that

395
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:15,440
we can just delete this particular row from here we can say remove field and since we want to have

396
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:23,920
a comparison across the number of family members which we already have the average of here and

397
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,520
amongst the rows we want the passenger class so we can just drag this over here and that's how

398
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:38,480
it changes so let's also try and modify this a bit we can say that we want to see this in the

399
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,240
descending order by the average number of family members and not want to see any blanks so there

400
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:50,240
it is so that makes sense essentially between the first and the second class the average number of

401
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:56,320
family members is 0.7 and in the third class it's one so essentially most of the people

402
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,960
in the third class on an average were traveling with one other family member

403
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,960
whereas people in the first and the second classes had smaller families

404
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:13,360
now the next few questions which is how do number of family members compare across age or

405
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:19,760
embarkment those are simply modifications of the same pivot table that we have already added

406
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:26,880
so you can do them as exercises but let's move on to the next pattern of insight which is

407
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,080
surprising extremes so let's take a look at the first question that we ask which passenger class

408
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:39,360
had the highest or the lowest passengers so let's take a look at this this also requires

409
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:45,200
a kind of a pivot table but a slightly different aggregation so let's go and insert

410
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:53,200
the pivot table over here say that's the correct pivot table here we basically want to insert

411
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:00,160
the passenger class along the rows now in the values since we simply want the count of the

412
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,520
passenger class we can take any other column so let's just take something like survived but this

413
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:13,040
time we instead of the sum we want count so when we go to field settings and we can simply replace

414
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:21,600
them by count and click okay so that's basically the idea in the first class we had 216 passengers

415
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:28,160
in the second class we had 184 passengers and in the third class we had more than twice of

416
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:34,960
any of the other two classes 491 passengers so that makes sense like third class was the largest

417
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:42,080
class of passengers let's move on to the next question which is

418
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:50,800
which passenger class had the highest or the lowest men or women so let's take a look we can

419
00:49:50,800 --> 00:50:05,360
again insert a pivot table and here also we need to do a count so along the lows we want

420
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:12,960
the passenger class and along the values we want the sex fields but here in the case of

421
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:24,960
this particular sum we basically want to change it so that we can just do a differentiation between

422
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,920
men and women so it seems like this is not something we can have over here we can also drag sex into

423
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:38,640
the columns so that will basically give us the male and female part separately so there it is

424
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,560
essentially in the first class there were 94 females and 122 males in the second class there

425
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:53,280
were 76 females and 108 males and in the third class there were 144 women and 347 males we can

426
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,120
also take this a step further and actually calculate the gender ratio so essentially that

427
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:05,440
is simply the number of women divided by the number of men in that particular class and let's take a

428
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:12,320
look at what that tells us so we have this value you'll see that a large formula has appeared here

429
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,880
that is because this is not a literal value this is a computed value the pivot table has actually

430
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,960
computed that value for us and then we divide it by this particular value and we press enter

431
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,880
and that's basically the gender ratio for the first class again let's do the same here we say

432
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:36,720
that we want to divide this value slash this value and there it is and then again for the last class

433
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:43,840
we say we want to divide this value by this value and then again for the sake of presentation

434
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:52,320
let's format these as percentages and here is where we see our first surprising output

435
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:59,120
essentially the gender ratio of the third class is the lowest of the three classes we have

436
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:04,320
steadily decreasing gender ratios between the first and the second class but they are still

437
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,840
fairly high 77 percent and 70 percent but the gender ratio of only 41 percent is too low

438
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:18,800
why this is important is because the gender ratio in the third class of passengers was very low

439
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,640
it is also possible that it is because of this that their overall survival rate could have gone

440
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:31,200
down now we can divide the passengers into using any of these columns essentially we can divide

441
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:37,520
them by survival you can divide them by passenger class we can divide them by age also sex also but

442
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:43,680
that is trivial we can divide them by age and you know where they particularly embarked and so on

443
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:51,360
whichever way we try to divide our passengers if in that particular cohort or in that particular

444
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:57,120
classification of passengers there are more females then it is likely that the survival rate

445
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,920
of that particular group of passengers is going to be higher so essentially if we were to divide

446
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:08,960
them by class and we see that a particular class has more females then the overall survival rate

447
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:16,320
of that class gets pushed up at the same time if we were to divide age groups into a bunch of

448
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,360
if we were to divide passengers by age groups and if a particular age group has more women in it

449
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:28,640
then simply because there are more women in it and because women were basically allowed

450
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:35,520
to evacuate the Titanic before them and that fact alone pushes the survival rate of that group

451
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:42,160
so basically so far we have seen that the survival rate by class of the third class is very low

452
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,480
and one of the reasons why that could be happening simply is because their gender ratio is very low

453
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:55,600
if they had enough if they had a high enough representation of women well representation is

454
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:01,600
a wrong word if they had a high enough gender ratio then it's possible that their overall survival

455
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,840
rate could also have increased

456
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,360
so there we are and let us continue with the questions

457
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:22,240
now you see that many of the following questions can also be solved again just by extending the

458
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:28,080
same sort of pivot table and cross tabulation that we have been doing so far so let's jump

459
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:35,920
directly to the next section of insights which is abnormal distributions so let's take a look at

460
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:42,240
what is the distribution of passengers across age one quick way to do that simply is to draw

461
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:48,960
a histogram and as we know we can simply select a column and go to the insert tab where we are

462
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:55,040
going to see a bunch of charts now let's take a look at recommended charts sometimes what you

463
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,880
find is directly available in the recommended charts and there it is so we want to draw a

464
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:07,600
histogram now what this tells us simply is that most people fell in this particular bucket which

465
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:16,080
is basically the age group of 17.5 to 23 years so most people were actually between the age of 17

466
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:24,560
and a half and 23 years we had quite a few people who are below six years of age and we had very

467
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:31,520
few people above 63 years of age we see that we have less than 10 people who are basically above

468
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:38,240
63 years of age now we see that since we have so few old people it's one of the reasons why

469
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:47,360
basically the survival rate of senior citizens over here is so high it's basically when we try

470
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:55,600
to calculate the survival rate of the passengers by age we saw that in the age group of 80 to 90

471
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,800
the survival rate is one that simply could be because there is exactly one fellow over here

472
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:06,080
one particular passenger who happened to survive and that's what's pushing that survival rate to

473
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:13,360
a very high value and that clearly you know the age decreases as the number of people who are

474
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:20,640
older decreases and there are a bunch of people who are young there are a lot of people who are

475
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:28,800
well young adults there are a few people who are middle age so when we say that we are looking at

476
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,120
the distribution of a particular column essentially what we're doing is talking about what its

477
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:39,120
histogram looked like and we don't see anything surprising over here so this is not what we would

478
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:49,200
call an abnormal distribution let's take a look at the next question which is essentially what is

479
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:54,720
the distribution of passengers across passenger class now if you think about this a simple way

480
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,280
to do this would be simply to take the counts of all the passengers in all different classes

481
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:05,200
and sum them up but we have actually already done this so essentially we have the three classes

482
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,880
over here and we have the grand total of the passengers over here so we can just select these

483
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:19,680
three rows and create a new chart out of this instead of actually creating a chart through the

484
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:25,840
usual way which is recommended charts doesn't show anything all of these charts will not work so for

485
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:31,200
example if i try to click a 2d line it's basically going to give me this but this doesn't tell me

486
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:40,400
anything one easy way to essentially click or basically view a particular chart which is coming

487
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,960
from the result of a pivot table is to straight away look at pivot chart which we see over here

488
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:54,480
so let's look at the pivot chart and there it is essentially this is the distribution of passengers

489
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,480
across the three classes we see that this also reflects what we know about the gender ratio

490
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,880
it's high in the first two classes and it's very low in the last class and there are far too many

491
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:17,680
men in the third class so not entirely surprising that this particular class received many fatalities

492
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:29,440
so yes this overall may not be a abnormal distribution but what is abnormal over here

493
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:37,120
is essentially the gender ratio it should not have been so low but then there might be certain

494
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:42,400
socio-economic factors which have led to this obviously the people who were traveling in the

495
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:50,320
third class were poor people and remember that the titanic sank in the year 1912 and those were the

496
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:57,040
times when europe was in the grip of the first world war or at least the onset of the first world

497
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:04,240
war the economy wasn't great and a lot of people were leaving their european homes to travel to

498
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,600
the united states and one of the reasons why united states was a major destination at that time

499
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:20,240
was because it had largely been untouched by the first world war so that is why it was perhaps a

500
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:27,840
reasonable choice for a lot of men to go and seek employment in the united states

501
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:33,280
and obviously they probably did not have the resources to carry their families with them

502
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,720
if they had then maybe this gender ratio would have gone up but that didn't happen and

503
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:45,200
unfortunately the titanic sank and so did all these well at least most of these people who

504
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,680
were traveling in the third class

505
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,880
now all of that by the way is just a hypothesis which i have put together

506
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,560
in the spur of the moment using some of my own general knowledge obviously

507
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,280
if you would like to actually validate this with data you're most welcome to do so

508
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,680
and maybe treat that as a homework assignment

509
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:14,880
let's take a look at the next question which is essentially what is the distribution of

510
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:23,200
passengers across the fair so essentially what we want to do is simply take the histogram of

511
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:31,280
the fair column let's move this chart out of the way let's select fair and simply go to the insert

512
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:38,400
part and click on recommended charts we see that we have a bunch of charts and let's particularly

513
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:47,360
pick the histogram and there it is we see that a lot of passengers played played like really

514
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:53,680
really low values and basically about 500 passengers paid less than 18 pounds or whatever

515
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:02,000
the currency is many of them paid between 18 to 36 pounds many of them between 36 to 54 and

516
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,200
it goes on decreasing that makes sense because the cheapest ticket went to the largest class

517
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:15,120
of passengers but this is definitely somewhat abnormal because you would expect the curve to

518
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:22,080
fall obviously because a lot more people will be playing paying say cheaper tickets paying for

519
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:26,800
cheaper tickets and a lot fewer people would be paying for more expensive tickets but you

520
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:33,840
wouldn't expect the curve to fall so quickly you would probably expect it to fall a little more

521
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,960
smoothly essentially what this means is that there is this one slot of tickets which has 500

522
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,480
people and the second slot has less than half that amount which doesn't make really too much sense

523
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,720
at the same time we don't even know what sort of division there is between

524
01:01:53,280 --> 01:02:00,480
the fares by class what is exactly the threshold here above which we have the first class rates

525
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,840
below which we have the second class rates and so on maybe that can be inferred from the

526
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,480
cabin information over here so if somebody has too many cabins they like for example this

527
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,440
particular person has three cabins allotted to them and we might want to figure out whether

528
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,640
that leads to a higher fare clearly does you see that 263 pounds is a fairly high value over here

529
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:28,880
so in summary this chart that we see here well it's definitely an abnormal distribution at least

530
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:37,600
until we can dig deeper and find out what the what is exactly the logic behind a fair curve that falls

531
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:44,560
so sharply so this is broadly how you can apply patterns of insights and come up with

532
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:52,400
so this is broadly how you can apply patterns of insights and come up with different questions

533
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:58,400
and use those questions to drive our analysis we saw that we went through all the patterns of

534
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,120
insights we drafted a bunch of questions we did not solve all of them in fact you're welcome to

535
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:08,320
solve the remaining questions on your own and share them with us during one of our interactive

536
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:16,000
sessions that would make for a really good exercise and you see that just by following

537
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,920
this process rigorously we have at least two or three very solid things to say about the dataset

538
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:28,400
and that is kind of the point of patterns of insight if you rigorously follow those patterns

539
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:34,320
if you carefully frame your questions and actually chase the patterns down carefully you will have

540
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:40,560
at least a few very insightful things to say to your client to your audience and that is how they

541
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:48,720
are intended to be used so i hope you have fun with this all the best and i'll see you next time
