00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,480
Welcome back. In this video we are going to take a look at how we can do some sort of bivariate

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,080
analysis using Excel. We've already taken a fairly detailed look at how we can do arithmetic using

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,840
Excel and how we can extend that arithmetic to do univariate analysis on continuous as well as

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,760
discrete columns. Here let's take a look at what happens when we try to do bivariate analysis. Now

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,520
as we know in order to do bivariate analysis we are going to need two columns either a pair of

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:36,880
continuous columns or a continuous and a discrete columns. So let's start with a pair of continuous

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,840
columns which is sepal length and sepal width. So we know that one of the most useful graphical

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,960
ways of checking correlation or essentially independence between two continuous variables

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,920
is to look at a scatter plot. So we have selected these two columns and since scatter plot is a

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,720
chart we can just go to the insert tab over here and then click on this particular

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,440
button here which simply says x y scatter. So we just click on this and there we have it. This is

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,320
basically the scatter plot of sepal length versus sepal width and you might have expected that

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,840
if sepal length grows then sepal width also grows but that doesn't seem to be the case over here.

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,800
In fact if you look at this blob here what that tells us is that there is no increasing or

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,240
decreasing sort of a strict relationship. Now that is something that we have inferred by simply

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,480
looking at this particular plot. We still do not have a quantitative idea of how much correlation

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,800
there is between the sepal length and the sepal width and of course we have a formula directly

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,440
to compute it which is called simply Corel and there we just say that we want to give it an array

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,920
basically a pair of arrays array 1 and array 2 and it's going to compute the correlation between

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,960
them. So let's say that I want to fill in my array I can just click on a over here so if it fills in

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,840
a colon a for us and then I put a comma space and then I click on b which is b colon b and I finish

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
the parenthesis and I press enter. So that's basically the correlation between sepal length

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,400
and sepal width and surprisingly you see it's actually it has a negative sign which means that

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,200
there is negative correlation between the sepal length and sepal width which means that as one

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,960
increases the other doesn't increase it decreases and even that relationship even the decreasing

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,920
relationship between them is very small because the magnitude tells us that it's a very small

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,240
magnitude it's in fact 0.08 which means that the extent to which one decreases as the other

28
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,560
increases is very small and the sign basically tells us whether it's an increasing relationship

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,560
or a decreasing relationship and now we what we graphically saw from this we basically saw that

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,760
there is almost no correlation these are mostly randomly scattered values that is reflected by

31
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,800
the very tiny value of correlation that we're getting here and basically as one increases the

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,120
other decreases that is not something we could have inferred by simply looking at this so that

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,480
is given by the mathematical quantity the negative sign tells us that there is and there is a

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:16,480
decreasing relationship. Now petals are a far more you know important characteristic of a flower and

35
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:23,040
you might expect that bigger petals mean that as a petal length increases the petal width also

36
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,120
increases so we might expect to find positive correlation between these two columns let's try

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,440
that as well let's select the petal length column and also the petal width column then go back to

38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,920
the insert tab click on the xy scatter menu select the scatter plot and there it is that's basically

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,080
the scatter plot of petal width versus petal length and we see that you know there is a fairly

40
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,240
linear trend over here of course there is a cluster over here and there is another cluster

41
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,760
over here as you might have guessed these clusters depend on the species so this is basically

42
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,960
one species and this is a combination this large cluster that we see over here is a combination

43
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:07,200
of the other species now graphically again looking at this might lead us to believe that

44
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,480
there is a very high positive correlation between petal width and petal length but in

45
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:20,160
order to actually verify this value let's also try and do the correlation and we have the first

46
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,280
array which is petal length which is the c column so we say c to c and then we say d to d for petal

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,440
width and then we press enter and we get a value of 0.96 so the magnitude of the value which is

48
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,120
very high indicates that there is indeed a very strong correlation between petal length and petal

49
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,800
width obviously as one increases the other also increases and that increasing relationship is

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,160
given to us by the positive sign and there is a very high correlation so the relationship between

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:05:03,040
them is very dominant so this is broadly how we do bivariate analysis between a pair of continuous

52
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,160
variables we draw a scatter plot and we look at the correlation so we have the graphical and the

53
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,520
mathematical aspects both covered with excel however we still haven't considered what we can

54
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,720
do when one of our variables is categorical and the other is a numerical variable as you remember

55
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,160
from the previous video what we do in this case is something called grouping and aggregation you

56
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,560
group any particular continuous variable let's say something like petal width by each unique

57
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,760
value of species that occurs and then you try to do some aggregation on that individual group

58
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,240
the easiest way to do this in excel is something called a pivot table so let's select an empty cell

59
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,440
go to the insert tab and then we click on pivot table so that basically asks us to select a

60
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,040
table or a range now the table that we want to consider is basically this one so it's all the

61
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,760
sepal length sepal width petal length petal width and the species column and we want to essentially

62
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,160
insert this into the existing worksheet we don't want to create a new file so we leave this

63
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,120
particular option selected and then we click on okay and that basically gives me my pivot table

64
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,200
over here now in order to populate this pivot table i can look at this menu over here now here

65
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,000
what i say is that along the rows of this pivot table i want species so basically i drag species

66
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,600
from the field day menu over here into the rows menu over here and that gives me all the row labels

67
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,880
sir to sir versiculum and virginica and the blank are basically because we have values that are

68
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,920
extending beyond the row 139 as well we can ignore that one and then we say that the values that i

69
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,200
want are say the sepal length so i drag the sepal length down to the values colon and you see that

70
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,680
it says that it's giving me the sum of sepal length now what if we don't want the sum of

71
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,200
sepal length well i can just right click on this particular element over here and i can go to field

72
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,320
settings and here it basically says that sum of the sepal length is the field name and it is

73
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,760
summarized by sum however i can change it to average to count max min anything i want so let's

74
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,440
take average for now so that's basically average and as you see the field name changes to average

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,040
of sepal length and then i click on okay so what this means is that for setosa flowers the average

76
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,120
sepal length is this much for versicular the average sepal length is that much and for virginica

77
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,720
it is that much now of course i can do the same with all other values that is all other types of

78
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,720
numerical columns so this is one case of bivariate analysis i have taken one particular

79
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,560
categorical column i have taken another numerical column and i have applied some sort of

80
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,480
aggregation on that column which in this case is the average i can add the sum as well so let's say

81
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,720
i want to simply click on this again and that gives me my menu back i say not only i want the

82
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,840
average but i also want the sum so again i can drop sepal length into the values menu over here

83
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,120
and here again i get the sum let's remove the sum for now because anyway

84
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,440
it's not going to help us much so let's say i can just right click on the values field again

85
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:26,720
and do a remove field so i can also drop sepal width i can drop petal length i can also drop

86
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,120
petal width so here is my entire pivot table where i say that i have against the setosa species the

87
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,880
average sepal length the total sepal width the total petal length and the total petal width

88
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,320
now of course like we demonstrated earlier we can change these aggregations from sum

89
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,720
to average so basically let's or basically sum to anything else so let's say i click on this

90
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,960
i right click on this and then again i go to field settings and when i look at this i can

91
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,360
just do an average and i can do basically this becomes my average again here i can right click

92
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,600
on the sum of petal length i can go to field settings again and then i can do a minimum

93
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:22,000
instead of a sum or an average so basically that is my minimum value so there it is we have basically

94
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:32,240
one categorical variable we have four numerical variables and we have four different aggregations

95
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,600
specified against all of them so this is something that lets me perform bivariate analysis

96
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:48,960
when both my columns are of a different type that is one is categorical versus other is numerical
