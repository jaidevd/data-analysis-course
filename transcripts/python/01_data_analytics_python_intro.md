Hello, and welcome to this course on Data Analytics with Python. My name is
Jaidev Deshpande, and I'm an Associate Principal Data Scientist at Gramener,
which is a data science company.

We are collecting more and more data than ever before in history. And there's an
entire industry around analyzing and interpreting this data. The objective of
this course is to not only make you comfortable with the practice of data
analytics, but also to make you significantly competent within this industry.

So far, we have mostly been grasping at straws - analysis has not been able to keep up with the
volume of data. It seems like no matter how much money or energy we invest in
analyzing data, we cannot keep up with the demand. One of the major reasons why
this happens is because data analysis as an industrial discipline tends to be
fairly ad-hoc in it's approach to data. One of the most important things you are
going to learn in this course is how to take a structured approach towards
analyzing data. You will see that having a structure, a process makes you
significantly more effective. It brings more discipline and rigour to the
practice, it helps you avoid wastage - wastage of analysis, wastage of energy and
ultimately wastage of time and money. And since it's a well defined, well structured process,
with some luck, you should also be able to automate this process.


A major aspect of this course is the tool we will use - Python and some of its
libraries. Python is an old language, in fact it's older than Java. But it's
use as a primary langauge for data science has exploded in the last few years.
More and more practitioners are slowly moving away from domain specific tools like MATLAB, R
and even Excel towards Python. The reason is that Python is the only general
purpose programming language that has a plethora of different easy to use
libraries for data analysis. Note that data analysis is usually only one block
in a larger pipeline which ultimately creates a product or a service. Having the
whole pipeline in a single language is easier for most developers and
practitioners, rather than having a different software stack for each block.

Having said that, also note that we will only be using Python as a vehicle for 
analytics. In the analytics industry, the only thing as abundant as the data
itself is opinions about which tool is the best. And I believe that the sooner
you try to lay this question to rest, the better. Tools do not matter, technique does.
A good analyst is
someone who is able to perform good analysis with any tool. The idea is not to
overfit on one tool, but to be able to pick up different tools fairly quickly. The best tool you
have is between your ears. So ultimately, my job here is to teach the process
and methods of data analysis, with Python as a tool, a vehicle.
You should be able to replicate this process with any other tool that you are
comfortable with. In fact, that would be a good test of how well you have
understood the material.

So with that, let's get started.
