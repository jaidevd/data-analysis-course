00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,960
Welcome back. In this video, we are going to take a look at one of the most powerful features that

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,920
Excel has to offer in terms of how it presents data, that is conditional formatting. We have

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,960
seen that one way to present data and insights in general is through charts, but sometimes we

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,680
also need to look at the raw data values, that is the numbers or the text that are actually

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,800
occurring in our tables. And as you can see, sometimes that is not very easy because all

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,080
you have is a bunch of numbers and text. However, when we do some analysis, we extract some summary

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,440
values or some statistics or some sort of metrics from the data. And conditional formatting is

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,800
something that helps us highlight some interesting statistics out of all the analysis that we have

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:57,920
done. It's fairly powerful and it has saved my life more than I'd like to admit. So let's get

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:05,680
started. As usual, this is fairly small. So let's go to the view tab and let's increase the zoom

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,960
value to 200% so that we can see the data a little better. And let's freeze the top row so that

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,960
Excel understands that that is our row header. Essentially, what that means is that no matter

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,040
how much I scroll, I can still see the top header and it understands that this is the label for each

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,440
given column. So let's take a look at how we can use conditional formatting to look at some insights

15
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,400
or some summary statistics of this data at just a glance.

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,880
Now, the single entry point into conditional formatting is through the home tab under the

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,160
conditional formatting button. And when you click on this, you'll see a bunch of drop downs. Let's

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,600
take a look at the first one. You see that we have this thing called highlights and rules,

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,600
which means that these are a bunch of rules that will help us highlight certain cells within our

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,120
selection. As you can see, our selection here is the column A, which is the simple length column.

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,880
So let's take a look. You see that we want to highlight cell rules which are,

22
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,640
suppose, greater than a certain value. So when you click on that, you get this new formatting rule

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,560
dialog. This essentially helps us create a new formatting rule. A rule, a formatting rule rather,

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,640
is just basically a set of conditions that are applied on every single cell within whatever

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,600
selection that we have made. And Excel makes a decision whether it has to highlight that

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,400
particular cell in a certain way or not. So essentially, we are saying that only format

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,040
cells that contain something, which is a cell value of greater than something else. So let's

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,560
say we have cell values going from 5.1, 4.9, 5, and well, mostly we see values that are between

29
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,120
5 and 4. So let's say that we want to highlight everything that's greater than 5. And we want to

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,680
format it with light red fill with dark red text. Essentially, the background of the cell is going

31
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,240
to be light red and the content or the text of the cell is going to be dark red. And let's just

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:24,800
click on OK. So there it is. Whichever cell has a value of more than 5 gets highlighted

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,120
in a light red background with a dark red text. Now this itself was just random. We did not

34
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,560
necessarily put too much thought into how we want to design this formatting rule. And we can see that

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,240
the more we scroll, basically the formatting has been applied to the whole column. We didn't really

36
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,080
put too much thought into this. This was just an illustration, an example. So let us clear this out

37
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,000
and try something slightly more meaningful. So then again, to clear it out, since our original

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,960
selection was the entire column, we recreate that selection by selecting the whole column.

39
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,960
We click on conditional formatting, and that again shows us the formatting menu. And here we

40
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,560
have an option called clear rules. So then under that, we have two other options, which is clear

41
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,760
rules from the selected cells or clear rules from the entire sheet. Now, it doesn't matter which one

42
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,920
we click over here because we have made basically any selection rules that we have made are the ones

43
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,240
on this particular selection. There are no selections outside of this. So we can simply

44
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,640
click this and it takes away the formatting. But in general, do be careful with the clear rules

45
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,760
because sometimes accidentally you might click on clear rules from the entire sheet and that

46
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,000
can actually throw away a lot of hard work that you have done while arranging formatting rules

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,080
for the rest of your sheet. So this is how you can add a particular conditional formatting rule

48
00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:02,320
and clear it. Let us try to take a shot at trying to create formatting rules that are a little more

49
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,080
mathematically analytically meaningful. Let us say that in this column, separate length,

50
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:17,600
we want to try and find the outliers. So one good way to find out outliers in any numerical variable

51
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,720
as we have covered in one of our previous videos is to find the average and then find the standard

52
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,200
deviation. Whichever value is more than two standard deviations above or more than two standard

53
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,040
deviations below the average can count as an outlier. So let's try that. Let us say that we

54
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,040
want to calculate the mean first, which is the average of the separate length. So let us just say

55
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,880
that average separate length and we already know the formula for that. So let us say equal to

56
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,280
average and as we have studied in one of our previous videos, we just give the selection range,

57
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,640
which in this case would be the entire column. So I can just click on the entire column and that

58
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,680
gets translated into A is to A. Let's finish the parentheses and press enter. So that's it.

59
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,040
That's basically in centimeters, what is the average separate length in my whole data sets,

60
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,680
5.83. And in order to detect the outliers, the one other metric that I'm going to need

61
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,400
is the standard deviation as well. So let us say we have a standard deviation for the separate length

62
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:36,960
and let that be also computed with a formula. We already have a formula for that STDEV.P.

63
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,880
Remember that we have two functions here STDEV.P and STDEV.S. The STDEV.P corresponds to the

64
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,200
population standard deviation, whereas the S corresponds to the sample standard deviation.

65
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,520
We are more interested in the population standard deviation. Again, the range that we want to give

66
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,160
is A is to A and there it is. So we know that the standard deviation of sample length in this data

67
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,200
set is 0.82 centimeters. Now, in order to detect an outlier, what we need to do is find out which

68
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,280
values are more than two standard deviations away from the average. That is, they are more than two

69
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,280
standard deviations either above or below the average. So let's compute something like that.

70
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:32,480
We say that average plus 2 STDEV is basically, I again press equal to so that Excel knows that

71
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:41,120
I am entering formula. It is essentially this value plus 2 times this value and then I press enter.

72
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,840
So basically, I am saying that whichever value for sample length is more than 7.49 is an outlier

73
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:55,120
to the upper side. Similarly, I can take a limit to the lower side as well. I can say average minus

74
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:05,760
2 times 2 STDEV is basically equal to, I again take the average and this time I do minus 2 times

75
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,240
this particular value. So there we are. So whatever is greater than this is an outlier

76
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,200
and whatever is less than this is also an outlier. Now that we have these values which are

77
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,160
basically the thresholds for the upper and lower limits, we can recalculate our conditional

78
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,000
formatting. So let's click on the on the column again and add a conditional formatting rules

79
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,640
for the first time to find out which are the upper outliers. Let's say that we want to find

80
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,840
out again with the greater than rule and here we say that color with the same color scheme that

81
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:52,880
we had earlier, light red background text and dark red cell color and dark red text and in this

82
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,120
case greater than I just click this particular value and then I press OK and there it is.

83
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,840
So none of these values are obviously outliers but as we scroll along we will see that we have some

84
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:14,960
values just 1.6, 7.7 and so on which are outliers. Now if we see that we see that almost no outlier

85
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,840
in sepal length can be found in the setosa or even the versicolor species of the iris flower.

86
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,440
Most of the outliers to the upper side that we see are found in virginica. What this means is that

87
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,480
if we find any value of sepal length which is more than 2 times greater 2 times the standard

88
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,040
deviation away from the mean that would mean that it's probably a virginica flower. So this is

89
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,640
an example of how you can apply conditional formatting and quickly at a glance see values

90
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:54,240
that allow us to infer some sort of a useful insight from our data set. The idea is that if

91
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,760
we have something as simple as this then we don't really even have to do something like machine

92
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,120
learning or classification or anything like that. We know at a glance that high sepal lengths

93
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,720
correspond more likely towards the virginica species rather than the versicolor and the

94
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,480
setosa species. Now that's for the upper limit of the outlier. What do we have for the lower

95
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,920
limit of the outliers? Let's try that again. Again I click on A. Again I go to the conditional

96
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,680
formatting menu and add another rule. This time I say that I want values which are less than a

97
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,760
particular value. So let's click on that. We say that we want a cell value which is less than

98
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,560
this particular value which is h9 which is average minus 2 the standard deviation but I want to color

99
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,560
it with a different scheme. So let's say I want to have a green fill with dark green text. So

100
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,560
basically the exact opposite of what we had earlier. We want to color the lower outliers in

101
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,720
green rather than the thread as we had earlier. Let's click on OK again and you see that

102
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,120
we have pretty much no outliers to the lower limit. Of course all of this got scaled because

103
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,600
it's interpreting that as zero but we see that on the lower side at least by this particular rule

104
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,920
we have no outliers. We only have upper outliers.

105
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:26,560
Now we only have highlighted upper outliers. We did not find any lower outliers but that also

106
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,160
leaves a bunch of these values unhighlighted. So if I wanted to see what happens if I were to

107
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,480
range the entire, if I were to highlight the entire range of values, let's see how to do that.

108
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,440
So basically we know what to do when something is more than two standard deviations away from

109
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,360
the mean but let's say that we also want to find out what happens when a value is between the mean

110
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,960
and the first standard deviation on either side. So for that let's calculate what happens when we

111
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:02,880
have the average plus the first standard deviation. That would just be the average

112
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,240
plus this particular value which is the standard deviation and let's press Enter and also we need

113
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,920
something which counts the same limit to the lower side which is average minus the first standard

114
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,160
deviation. So that would then be equal to the average value which is this value minus the

115
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,520
standard sepal, the standard deviation of the sepal length and that's it. What we want to do is

116
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,240
find out what happens to values between them. So then we can add another conditional formatting

117
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,400
we say that we want to highlight cells which are this time between two values not greater than not

118
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,320
less than but between so there it is. We say that we want to highlight cell values which are between

119
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,480
this particular value on the lower side which is 5.00 something so let's just click on this

120
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,360
particular thing and the upper limit is this which is average plus one standard deviation

121
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,560
and since we saw that we did not have any lower outliers no outliers on the lower end of range

122
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,680
that particular value which we used which was for green that was left unused so we can just use the

123
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,320
same value again. So there it is and we can compute that so let's click on OK and there it is. So

124
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,440
these are basically values which fall between the mean and the first standard deviation. So now we

125
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,400
know what to do when something is either greater than the second standard deviation

126
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,040
less than the second standard deviation from the mean between the first and the second standard

127
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,800
deviation. The one other range that has been left out is what happens when a value is between the

128
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,160
first standard deviation and the second standard deviation. So essentially what happens to the

129
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:58,400
values that are between 6 and 7 and what are basically between 6.66 and 7.49 and the values

130
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:05,120
between 4.18 and 5.09. So let's add that as the third conditional formatting rule that should

131
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,800
by the way cover most of the values in this whole spectrum because as you can see the lower limit

132
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,200
is 4.18 so whatever is greater than this should get covered and let's again add that rule go to

133
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,520
conditional formatting highlight cell rules say between well for the upper limit we would have

134
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:32,320
something like we want a cell value that is between average minus the first standard deviation

135
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,680
which is or rather average minus the second standard deviation because we are moving from

136
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,920
left to right let's add that and average minus the first standard deviation and let's click OK.

137
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,920
This time let's pick a different color let's say yellow fill with dark yellow text that's good

138
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,400
enough and let's click OK and that covers some of the values of course we still haven't taken into

139
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:01,200
account what happens between the second standard deviations as well so let's do that again add

140
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,400
another rule highlight cell rules and we say that we want a value that is between this time on the

141
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,320
upper side of things basically what that means is we want values that are between

142
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,720
the first standard deviation only from the average and then the second standard

143
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,640
deviation only from the average and these also let's fill with yellow text so let's click OK.

144
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:33,440
Now with that you see we'll cover almost every value in the range so there we are now in order

145
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:41,440
to see everything at a glance let's go back to the view tab and zoom out let's do a 25% zoom so

146
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,800
that we can okay that's too small that's far too small let's go back to say 75% and we see this

147
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,440
whole range we see that most of the green values which was basically between the means and the

148
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,640
first standard deviation you see that they are laid out throughout the red values are all to the

149
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:07,520
bottom and the yellow values are mostly in the setosa range so that basically allows us to see

150
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:14,000
what our data distribution looks like with conditional formatting let's zoom back to 200%

151
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:22,320
to do further analysis one way to manage all the conditional formatting rules that we have applied

152
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,440
and note that these can quickly get out of hand basically we have applied more than two or three

153
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,200
rules from this one particular column one way to simply check that is go back to the home tab and

154
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,920
click on manage rules under the conditional formatting menu so what this gives me is a list

155
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,320
of all the rules that I have applied on this particular column it tells me that basically

156
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:53,040
there are two rules which make me which I have specified should be colored in yellow there are

157
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,600
two rules which should be colored in green and there is one rule which should be colored in red

158
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,480
so I can just you know delete either of them or I can add rules or I can remove rules basically

159
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,880
you can just make a particular selection here and go to the manage rules tab within conditional

160
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,000
formatting menu to see all the rules that are currently applied on that particular column

161
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,000
so this is something that is useful for rule management there's nothing to do over here so

162
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:31,520
let's just cancel this for now and continue so now that we know what to do with conditional

163
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,320
formatting how to add rules how to manage rules let's move on to another category of conditional

164
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,360
rules which are basically you know the top bottom rules which we call the top bottom rules the

165
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,480
earlier ones that we were simply that we used were simply called the highlights and rules which

166
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,000
take care of basic logic like greater than less than equal to and so on top bottom rules are rules

167
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,560
that inherently do some mathematics for us so basically they are going to find the top 10

168
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,400
percent they are going to find the bottom 10 percent they are going to find the above average

169
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,360
and the below average and so on now of course we are going to let's say apply it on a separate

170
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,920
column let's in order just in the interest of clarity remove all the rules that we have

171
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,840
applied to see for length over here just so that we can see the data better in order to remove

172
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,240
rules we can just go to clear rules and say clear rules from selected sets so let's do that and then

173
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:30,320
our set is blank now let's apply the top bottom rules on the simple width column so let's highlight

174
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,240
that row and then click on conditional formatting and say that I want some top bottom rules now I

175
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,480
want to say highlight the top 10 percent of all the rows the top 10 percent values in all the

176
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,360
rows so let's click on that thing and say that I want the top 10 percent to be colored in red

177
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,480
so let's click okay and we see that some values already show up then let's add another rule which

178
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,000
says that I want the bottom 10 percent to also be colored in red because essentially let's say

179
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,840
we are just interested in looking at the outliers so there it is we have all of the lowest and all

180
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,880
of the largest values covered in red then I can also add another thing which says that everything's

181
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,320
that above the average I want it colored in green and then I click on okay now you see that one of

182
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,880
the things that happened is that some of the rules that were colored earlier in red are now colored

183
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:33,040
in green the reason that happens is because the earlier rule is now conflicting with this current

184
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:39,040
rule and this rule has overridden the previous rule so essentially the order in which we apply

185
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,440
rules also matters if you want to re-add that rule it is going to have to go here manage rules

186
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,920
and basically that above the top 10 and bottom 10 percent rule we just want to you know

187
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,480
order it in a certain way so we can just click on change rule order and so we say that

188
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,880
we want the above average to be executed the last and so then we click on okay and we see that some

189
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,480
of our red values which were actually top 10 or bottom 10 percent have resumed their original

190
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,960
color now we know what we have done with above average although to make sure we can always

191
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,480
check out manage rules and see what we have done so yeah we have covered above average in green

192
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,200
and we have covered the top and bottom 10 percent in red so let's cancel this and let's add another

193
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,240
rule we know what we have done with the above average value let's do something with the below

194
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,240
average values as well you see that I want to format all the values which are below the average

195
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:50,720
this time with yellow for example and let's click okay and there it is so those are all our values

196
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,320
again see at a glance we can see that virginica has a lot of yellow values which means that on

197
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,880
an average virginica sepal width is less than the average so we can use simply this particular

198
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,720
you know statistical fact to determine whether something is well it also seems like versicolor

199
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:18,560
also has the same rule so we can see simply that whatever is below average is likely to be either

200
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,760
versicolor or virginica but if we go back to setosa we see that a lot of values are

201
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,440
mostly green and red so they are in the either top few or definitely above average so if the

202
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,680
sepal width is too high the flower is more likely to be setosa and if the sepal width is too low

203
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,040
either below average or far too below average which is in the bottom few then we can say that

204
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,360
it's likely to be a virginica or a versicolor so this is again an example of how we can simply

205
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:54,560
use conditional formatting to figure out some very basic some very obvious insights from our data

206
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,280
so now that we know how to use the highlight cell rules and the top bottom rules let's go over to

207
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,360
the next most interesting type of conditional formatting which is data bars it's essentially

208
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,160
a way of trying to fill cells with bars which almost look like bar charts depending on the

209
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,080
value of the cell let's take a look at how this is important you see that in this particular data

210
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:32,480
set we have four continuous variables now one way to summarize the overall amount of variability in

211
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:39,440
a particular data set is to simply sum up the variance of all columns of all numerical columns

212
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,640
in that data set so let us try and find the variance of these four columns let's just copy

213
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,440
these column headers and paste them over here and here i can simply add a label called variance and

214
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,920
i can say as we have seen earlier we have a function called var.p which stands for population

215
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,760
variance and in this case for the sepal length i will just add a to a because that's my selection

216
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:11,280
and i just press enter and that's it 0.685 is the variance of sepal length and i can just drag it

217
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:20,640
to find the variances of all of the other columns now let's basically try and transpose this data

218
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,960
so essentially i want the sepal lengths or basically the column names not to appear in

219
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,720
columns here but in rows so in order to do that i can simply say equal to transpose transpose is

220
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,840
basically a function in excel which when it is given a particular range it's going to flip the

221
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,720
rows and the columns so when i complete the parenthesis and i press enter i get something

222
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,200
like this variance becomes a column and the columns which i had here become the rows so

223
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,280
essentially transpose is converting columns into rows and rows into columns now that i have the

224
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:02,240
variances for the four different columns i can also have something called total variance which

225
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,840
i can simply say is the sum of these four values and there it is something went wrong with my

226
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,080
formula i can do sum open a parenthesis and then make the selection yeah this time it fills

227
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,120
if i try to do a selection without opening a parenthesis it just stops everything it is

228
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,800
doing and starts making the selection which makes the formula go wrong so there it is so that is the

229
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,560
total variance i have let's drag this column limit slightly ahead so we can read properly

230
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:39,200
there it is now one of the most important tasks in summary statistics is to figure out how much

231
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,800
each column is contributing to the whole variance and that can be expressed as percentages so

232
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,560
basically i can just divide this by this and therefore express that as a percentage so let's

233
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,320
try to see how much variance sepal length is contributing to the total variance of the

234
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,600
data set well i can simply do that by dividing this value by this value and say that the

235
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,880
contribution of sepal length to the total variance is simply the variance of sepal length

236
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,280
divided by the total variance which is that and then i just press enter and then i can just

237
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,760
scroll down this value all the way over here and that essentially well it should have extended

238
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,440
that my formula but it did not now let's take a look at why i'm getting this divide by zero error

239
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,200
if i click on this particular cell i see that the formula is g18 by g22 now g18 is this and g22

240
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,920
is this particular value total variance so the variance of sepal length divided by the total

241
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:46,320
variance now if i click on this particular thing you see it's g19 by g23 not only while you're

242
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,520
dragging it's basically changed the row number it's actually also changed this number to 23

243
00:25:51,520 --> 00:26:00,480
so instead of making it change from g22 to g23 i want to keep g22 fixed because that's my value

244
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,160
over here so i can rewrite this formula as follows i can basically say that it's this value divided by

245
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:14,000
g dollar 22 what this means is that this number 22 is now going to stay fixed it's not going to

246
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,040
change and i enter that and then again when i drag it this time that gives me the right values

247
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,640
obviously the total variance divided by itself is going to be one and these are all the values i have

248
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,760
now of course the idea is to express these as percentages i want to figure out what percent

249
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,320
of the total variance is contributed by sepal length what percent is contributed by sepal width

250
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:46,480
what bipedal length and what bipedal width so in order to format a range of values or any selection

251
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,320
as percentages you can just make that selection and in the home tab click on this percent sign

252
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,800
so that basically formats my entire thing as percentages now obviously these are percentages

253
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,320
and i can quickly see that 68 is very high there is 30 there is 15 and there is a very small value

254
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,120
of 4 but if i wanted to see the whole thing at a glance i could just select the ranges i could go

255
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,280
to conditional formatting data bars and i can just pick one of the two gradient fill or solid fill

256
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:24,080
and click on one particular bar let's pick blue bars light blue data bar and there it is so basically

257
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,400
that's giving me a small tiny bar chart which is embedded in myself instead of creating a new one

258
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,680
which at a glance tells me that this particular value is very high of course if i were to take

259
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,440
the trouble of reading those values it would have been very obvious to me what a high value

260
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,320
is and what a low value is but you see that this is a kind of presentation that quickly catches

261
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,640
somebody's eye and just by looking at it i can tell you that peter length actually has a lot

262
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,200
of variance and now i can see it see out of the 4.54 3.07 is covered just by peter length

263
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:05,440
all of the others are very small so this is how we can use data bars to essentially present

264
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,480
percentages and proportions in a very easy to understand manner of course that's not the only

265
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,560
way we can also have something like a gradient fill so essentially a gradient fill is basically

266
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:25,600
something that has a color gradient it goes from very opaque to a little transparent and that

267
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,760
itself depends on the value it's the the rate at which the opaque part changes to the transparent

268
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,800
part the length and the rate of the change of transparency it depends on the value itself so

269
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,440
these are essentially conveying the same information but you might want to pick a particular color or

270
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,560
whether you wanted a solid or a transparent range depending on the overall theme of

271
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,760
your spreadsheet or whatever whatever your aesthetic sense asks you to do

272
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,560
now the next set of conditional formatting tools are called color scales and in order to

273
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,240
understand that let's revisit some of the formatting that we have done on one of our

274
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,080
existing columns in the case of simple length and simple width what we did initially in this video

275
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,640
is that we created some handmade rules that is we said that values that are beyond a certain

276
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,720
threshold we want them colored in green values that are above or below a certain threshold we want

277
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:38,080
them to get colored in red and intermediate values in yellow now color scales are essentially simply

278
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,800
an automatic way of doing that they are simply going to take the whole range of values in a

279
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:49,120
given selection and divide them across the different shades of a particular color scale

280
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,600
to understand that let's try it out with petal length so i make the selection i go to conditional

281
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:02,160
formatting and then i go to the color scales menu and i select the first one which is basically the

282
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,920
green yellow red color scale what this means is that lower values will be colored in green

283
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:15,440
middle values in yellow and high values in red so let's just click on that and that's how it is

284
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,600
well it turns out i was wrong i basically flipped the order around the low values are going to be

285
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,880
colored in red the middle values in green and the higher ones in yellow and you see again at a glance

286
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:36,080
we can see the behavior of petal length as it traverses across the different species

287
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:43,280
we can see that setosa values for petal length are mostly low versicolor are somewhere in medium

288
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:49,040
and virginica has really high petal lengths to see this in a more concise way let's go back

289
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:55,760
to the view tab and try to zoom out to say 75 percent and there we see it slightly better

290
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:04,160
the whole range as we go from top to bottom goes from red to yellow and orange and then finally

291
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:13,920
to green let's go back to the zoom the original zoom and there it is now to understand how color

292
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:21,120
scales work in a slightly more detailed fashion let's try a simple exercise let's say that i

293
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,400
again want my columns and i want to perform some sort of statistics on them again so i create

294
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,520
simply the mean which is let's just call it mean and i want to find out all the

295
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:46,320
stratifications above and below the mean so i have mean plus 1 std i have mean plus 2 std

296
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:56,720
i have mean minus 1 std and i have mean minus 2 std so let's see what values we can fill in

297
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,320
essentially the mean is just do we have the average somewhere well we have it here but let's

298
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:10,400
compute it again let's say that the mean is simply the average of a to a and then i simply

299
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,440
i simply drag this out and now we also need the standard deviation let's calculate the

300
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,600
standard deviation over here and say the standard deviation is a to a and oops

301
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:33,040
got the formula wrong again and we can say stdev dot p so that's a to a and that completes my

302
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,400
formula i have my standard deviation for the simple length then i drag it across i get it for

303
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,240
everything and for the mean plus 1 standard deviation i basically can enter the formula

304
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:51,280
say equal to this particular value plus this particular value and that's it then i can again

305
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:57,840
drag it across and there it is i have the mean plus the first standard deviation limit for all

306
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,680
the different types of continuous variables here i can again add another formula and i say

307
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:13,440
that i want the mean plus 2 times the standard deviation there it is and let me also drag that

308
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,000
across and that gives me the whole values and i just do the opposite on the other hand which is

309
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,600
basically take the mean and this time subtract 1 times the standard deviation and then i drag it

310
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,960
all across here i do the same thing but 2 times the standard deviation so i take the mean and i

311
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:44,480
do minus 2 times this particular value and that's it and then i drag this across as well oh well

312
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,720
here's a first surprise we see that the lower limit is going into a negative value here

313
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,600
so basically little width can't go below zero but it seems like in order to find the lower outlier

314
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,120
at least according to the normal distribution you need to go well into the negative value which

315
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:08,400
can't happen now here's what happens when we do a color scale on this particular table of values

316
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,640
let's go back to the home tab and then click on conditional formatting color scales and

317
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,800
pick the red yellow green color scale again click on that this is what we get you see that the

318
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,680
lowest value is red and the highest value is green now what can we infer from this well let's

319
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:36,240
take a look if you look at the values in the sepal length column you see that the lowest value which

320
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,600
is mean minus 2 standard deviation is a little bit in the green which means that it's somewhere

321
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:48,800
on the green yellow slightly somewhere on the mid side or the middle portion of the entire range

322
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,280
of values and the highest value is green which means that sepal lengths occupy mostly the higher

323
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:02,240
spectrum of the upper half spectrum of values whereas in sepal width we see that values go

324
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,640
from somewhere in the mid range all the way to some sort of a lower range petal length on

325
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,840
the other hand is a little strange you see that we have values which contains all shades of colors

326
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:22,560
it goes from slightly dark red to yellow to orange to greenish to red to orange to yellow to

327
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,800
greenish yellow to dark green this what this represents is that there is a lot of variation

328
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,840
in these values because in the same column you're seeing all shades of the color scale

329
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:40,320
that you have chosen and that actually corresponds to this particular value over here when we say

330
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,720
that 68% variance is found in petal length what that means is that these values are

331
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,920
they vary a lot there there is a lot of variance in the sense that values range all the way from

332
00:35:51,920 --> 00:36:01,600
0.02 or 0.2 to 7.25 that's basically a large range for a particular variable to cover and that fact

333
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:08,400
we can also see directly from this particular color scale essentially we're seeing colors that

334
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,480
range all the way from green to all the way down to red and similarly in petal width we see that

335
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:21,120
the variation is not so large it goes mostly from red to orange which means that occupies again the

336
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:28,880
lower bottom rung of the spectrum so you see that petal width since it has mostly no green values

337
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,840
it has a low variance and we know that it's basically 13% only petal length occupies most

338
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,640
of the values that are already present in the color spectrum of your color scale and that's why

339
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,240
it has a high variance this also has a very low variance because you see most of the values are

340
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,640
concentrated around orange yellow what do you want to call this color which is a very small

341
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,280
value of 4% and this also has a slightly high variance because we see values going all the

342
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,440
way from 4 to 7 which is reflected by the color scale again and that contributes to a variance

343
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,240
of 15% so essentially what we saw through bars over here you can also see through colors over

344
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,840
here so depending on what sort of presentation you want to make you can choose the right kind

345
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:21,360
of conditional formatting and see it one word of caution about how to pick color scales though

346
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,720
whenever you want to make a selection to draw color scales be careful about what selection you're

347
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,560
doing so basically let's say that we want to not drag this whole thing but we want to add a color

348
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,920
scale only to this particular value only to this particular column which is just the sepal length

349
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,200
and here again when i click on color scale and click here you see that i get those values and

350
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,360
then again if i do this other column independently of the first one i pick the same color scale add

351
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:57,040
it here again i pick the same color scale and add it and here again i pick the same color scale

352
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:06,000
and add it do you see what the problem is well the problem is that across all of these the color

353
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,720
scales are not changing at all it's like they are basically occupying the same range over here as

354
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:16,720
the same range over here or rather at the bottom row we see the same shade of red we see the same

355
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:24,080
shade of orange the same shade of yellow the same shade of green and dark green why this happens

356
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,840
is because whenever you select a color scale and then perform conditional formatting with any

357
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:36,160
particular color scale the range of that color scale essentially adapts to the values that have

358
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,440
been selected they don't adapt to the values around it so essentially if you want to compress

359
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,560
a bunch of values in the same color scale you have to make the whole selection work so here

360
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:53,360
this sort of a color scale is more valid because we want comparisons of this value with this value

361
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,320
with this value and with this value we don't want comparisons of a particular value with

362
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,320
only values in its own column so that is why be careful when making a selection for any

363
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:12,480
conditional formatting so broadly this is how you use conditional formatting to create highlights

364
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,800
in your data in your numbers well one quick other way of presenting your work is to show

365
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,800
charts but at the same time if you want people to look at numbers which sometimes cannot be avoided

366
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,000
and you want to draw their attention to certain sets of numbers first before others then conditional

367
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,720
formatting is one way you can do it and of course make sure that the inference that is being drawn

368
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,880
from this conditional formatting is obvious to people so that's it about conditional formatting

369
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,040
and I will see you in the next video thank you very much
