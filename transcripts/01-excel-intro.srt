Hello and welcome to this course on Data Analytics with Excel.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,560
My name is Jaidev, Jaidev Deshpande and I am Associate Principal Data Scientist at Gramener

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,320
which is a data science company.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,680
So you see we are collecting more and more data than ever before in history and there

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,240
is an entire industry around analyzing and interpreting bad data.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,400
The objective of this course is to not only make you comfortable with the practice of

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,960
data analytics but also to make you significantly competent within this industry.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,600
So far we have mostly been grasping at straws.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,400
Analysis has not been able to keep up with the volume of data.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,280
It seems like no matter how much money or energy we invest in analyzing data we cannot

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,400
keep up with the demand.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,000
One of the major reasons why this happens is because data analysis as an industrial

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,080
discipline tends to be fairly ad-hoc in its approach to data that is.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,960
One of the most important things that you are going to learn in this course is how to

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,000
take a structured approach towards analyzing data.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,200
You will see that having a structure, a process makes you significantly more effective.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,240
It brings more discipline and more rigor to the practice.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,040
It helps you avoid wastage which is a wastage of analysis, a wastage of energy and ultimately

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,160
wastage of time and money as well.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,800
So since it's a well defined, well structured process with some luck you should be able

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,360
to also automate this process.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,200
The final aspect of this course is the tool that we will use which is spreadsheets.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
Spreadsheets have quite simply changed the world.

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,840
If we as a species were to face extinction and had to preserve say our top five technologies

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,840
then spreadsheets would definitely be among them.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,200
In fact, Fred Brooks said that spreadsheets are one of the biggest innovations in computer

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,560
science since databases and high level programming languages.

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Excel is quite simply the single most versatile analytical tool anybody can use.

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,360
Dollar for dollar it far outweighs pretty much anything else.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,880
Of course, note that whatever we do with Excel in this course should also be doable with

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,320
any other spreadsheet software like LibreOffice, KLC or Google Sheets.

32
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:28,120
Having said that, also note that we will only be using Excel as a vehicle for analytics

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,680
in the analytics industry.

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,280
The only thing as abundant as the data itself is opinions about which tool is the best.

35
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,320
And I believe that the sooner you try to lay this question to rest the better.

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,560
My current boss is S. Anand who is the CEO of Gramener and consistently ranked in the

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,120
top 10 data scientists in India.

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,880
He says that tools do not matter, technique does.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,720
A good analyst is someone who is able to perform good analysis with any tool.

40
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,600
The best tool you have is between your ears.

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,320
So ultimately my job here is to teach you the process and the methods of data analysis

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,200
with Microsoft Excel just as a tool as a vehicle.

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,960
You should be able to replicate this process with any other tool that you are comfortable

44
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
with.

45
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,560
That would be a good test of how well you have understood the material.

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
So with that, let's begin.
